  "thinking": "The given expression is a polynomial in x0. First, I will expand and simplify the expression to identify its degree and coefficients. Then, I will analyze the asymptotic behavior of the polynomial based on its leading term. Since the leading coefficient is negative, the function will tend to negative infinity as x0 approaches positive or negative infinity, implying the existence of a global maximum. To find the global maximum, I will compute the first derivative of the function, find its roots (critical points), and evaluate the function at these critical points and at x0=0 (which is also a critical point for the derivative). The largest of these values will be the global maximum, which serves as the closest upper bound formula. Finally, I will determine the computational complexity of this upper bound formula.",
  "reasoning": "1. **Simplify the Expression:** The given expression is `x0 * x0 * (x0 * (0.003794269 + x0 * ( - 2.1076106e - 5)) - 1 * 0.093124814)`. Let's denote `x0` as `x` for simplicity in writing. \n `f(x) = x^2 * (x * (0.003794269 - 2.1076106e-5 * x) - 0.093124814)`\n `f(x) = x^2 * (0.003794269 * x - 2.1076106e-5 * x^2 - 0.093124814)`\n `f(x) = -2.1076106e-5 * x^4 + 0.003794269 * x^3 - 0.093124814 * x^2`\n This is a polynomial of degree 4.\n\n2. **Analyze Asymptotic Behavior:** The leading term is `-2.1076106e-5 * x^4`. Since the coefficient `-2.1076106e-5` is negative, `f(x)` tends to negative infinity as `x` approaches `+/- infinity`. This means the function has a global maximum.\n\n3. **Find Critical Points:** To find the global maximum, we need to find the critical points by taking the first derivative and setting it to zero.\n `f'(x) = d/dx (-2.1076106e-5 * x^4 + 0.003794269 * x^3 - 0.093124814 * x^2)`\n `f'(x) = 4 * (-2.1076106e-5) * x^3 + 3 * (0.003794269) * x^2 + 2 * (-0.093124814) * x`\n `f'(x) = -8.4304424e-5 * x^3 + 0.011382807 * x^2 - 0.186249628 * x`\n Set `f'(x) = 0`:\n `x * (-8.4304424e-5 * x^2 + 0.011382807 * x - 0.186249628) = 0`\n One critical point is `x = 0`. The other critical points are the roots of the quadratic equation:\n `-8.4304424e-5 * x^2 + 0.011382807 * x - 0.186249628 = 0`\n Using the quadratic formula `x = (-b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)`:\n `a = -8.4304424e-5`, `b = 0.011382807`, `c = -0.186249628`\n Discriminant `D = (0.011382807)^2 - 4 * (-8.4304424e-5) * (-0.186249628)`\n `D = 0.000129578 - 0.00006279 = 0.000066788`\n `sqrt(D) = sqrt(0.000066788) approx 0.0081723925`\n `x = (-0.011382807 +/- 0.0081723925) / (2 * -8.4304424e-5)`\n `x = (-0.011382807 +/- 0.0081723925) / -0.0001686088`\n `x_1 = (-0.011382807 + 0.0081723925) / -0.0001686088 = -0.0032104145 / -0.0001686088 approx 19.0405`\n `x_2 = (-0.011382807 - 0.0081723925) / -0.0001686088 = -0.0195551995 / -0.0001686088 approx 115.9801`\n The critical points are `x = 0`, `x approx 19.0405`, and `x approx 115.9801`.\n\n4. **Evaluate Function at Critical Points:**\n `f(0) = 0`\n `f(19.0405) = -2.1076106e-5 * (19.0405)^4 + 0.003794269 * (19.0405)^3 - 0.093124814 * (19.0405)^2`\n `f(19.0405) approx -2.1076106e-5 * 131400 + 0.003794269 * 6900 - 0.093124814 * 362.5`\n `f(19.0405) approx -2.769 + 26.180 - 33.770 approx -10.359` (This is a local minimum)\n\n `f(115.9801) = -2.1076106e-5 * (115.9801)^4 + 0.003794269 * (115.9801)^3 - 0.093124814 * (115.9801)^2`\n `f(115.9801) approx -2.1076106e-5 * 180940000 + 0.003794269 * 1560100 - 0.093124814 * 13451.387`\n `f(115.9801) approx -3810.70 + 5919.40 - 1253.90 approx 854.80` (This is a local maximum)\n\n5. **Determine Global Maximum:** Comparing the values at the local extrema: `f(0) = 0` and `f(115.9801) approx 854.80`. The global maximum value of the function is approximately `854.80`.\n\n6. **Closest Upper Bound Formula:** Since the function tends to negative infinity for large `|x|`, its global maximum value is the closest upper bound for all `x`. A constant value is a valid formula.\n\n7. **Complexity of the Upper Bound Formula:** The upper bound formula is a constant value (`854.80`). Evaluating a constant value requires a fixed number of operations, independent of the input `x0`. Therefore, its computational complexity is `O(1)` (constant time).",
