Therefore, the expression is interpreted as `3.500444e - 11 * x0 ** 2`. Let `C = 3.500444e - 11`. The expression becomes `C * x0^2`.\\n2.  **Identify the variable:** The variable in the expression is `x0`.\\n3.  **Address \\\"when K is large\\\":** The variable `K` is not present in the expression itself. This phrase is interpreted as a general context for asymptotic analysis, meaning we should consider the behavior of the function for large values of its independent variable, `x0`.\\n4.  **Determine the type of equation:** The function `f(x0) = C * x0^2` is a polynomial function of degree 2.

Since `f(x0) = C * x0^2` is already a polynomial function, it serves as its own least upper bound. Any function `g(x0)` that is asymptotically smaller than `x0^2` (i.e., `g(x0) = o(x0^2)`) would eventually be smaller than `C * x0^2` for sufficiently large `x0`, and thus could not be an upper bound. Therefore, `C * x0^2` is the tightest possible polynomial upper bound.\\n6.  **Explain why it is the upper bound:** The function `g(x0) = C * x0^2` is an upper bound for `f(x0) = C * x0^2` because `f(x0) <= g(x0)` (in fact, `f(x0) = g(x0)` for all `x0`). It is the *least* upper bound in the asymptotic sense because no function that grows strictly slower than `x0^2` can bound `C * x0^2` for large `x0`.\\n7.  **Analyze the complexity of the upper bound formula:** The upper bound formula is `C * x0^2`.
