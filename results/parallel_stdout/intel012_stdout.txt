The problem specifies that the formula should be an exponential or polynomial function with an integer exponent. A constant `C` can be expressed as a polynomial of degree 0, i.e., `C * K^0`. This fits the criteria of a 'polynomial function with integer exponent' (where the exponent is 0). The statement 'X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!' is a bit confusing, as linear functions (X^1) and constant functions (X^0) are indeed polynomials.
