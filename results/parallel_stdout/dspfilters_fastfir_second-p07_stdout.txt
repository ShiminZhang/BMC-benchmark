Even though `g(x0)` is sublinear in standard complexity theory, the problem's specific definition states 'X^K with K<=1 is still linear'.

Since the function is `1.166166 ^ (x0 ^ 0.18725726)`, its complexity is `O(1.166166 ^ (x0 ^ 0.18725726))`. This represents an exponential growth rate, specifically `O(b^(x^c))` where `0 < c < 1`.
