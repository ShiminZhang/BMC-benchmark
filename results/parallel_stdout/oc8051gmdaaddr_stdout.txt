The problem states `** means power 2**2 is 2^2`. So, `x0 * * 0.19640793` means `x0^2 * 0.19640793`, and `x0 * * 0.21174176` means `x0^2 * 0.21174176`.\\nLet `C = 1.29095383225845`.\\nThe expression can be rewritten as: `C * exp(-x0^2 * 0.19640793) * exp(x0^2 * 0.21174176)`.\\nUsing the property of exponents `exp(a) * exp(b) = exp(a + b)`, we combine the exponential terms:\\n`C * exp(-x0^2 * 0.19640793 + x0^2 * 0.21174176)`\\n`C * exp(x0^2 * (0.21174176 - 0.19640793))`\\nNow, calculate the difference in the coefficients:\\n`0.21174176 - 0.19640793 = 0.01533383`\\nSo, the expression simplifies to: `C * exp(x0^2 * 0.01533383)`.\\n\\nThe problem asks for the least upper bound formula \"when K is large\". However, `K` is not present in the expression. The only variable is `x0`. Given the context of finding an upper bound and analyzing complexity, it is highly probable that `K` is a typo and refers to `x0`. I will proceed with the assumption that `x0` is the variable that is considered \"large\".\\n\\nLet `f(x0) = C * exp(x0^2 * 0.01533383)`.\\nAs `|x0|` becomes large, `x0^2` becomes large and positive. Since the coefficient `0.01533383` is positive, the exponent `x0^2 * 0.01533383` also becomes large and positive. Consequently, `exp(x0^2 * 0.01533383)` grows without bound, and thus `f(x0)` grows without bound.\\n\\nFor a function that grows without bound, its least upper bound is typically the function itself, or a function that captures its exact asymptotic growth rate. The question asks for a \"formula\", so providing the exact function is the most precise answer for the least upper bound.\\n\\nThe derived formula `C * exp(x0^2 * 0.01533383)` is an exponential function, which fits the requirement that the formula should be either an exponential or a polynomial function.\\n\\nComplexity analysis: The dominant term in the function is `exp(x0^2)`. Therefore, the complexity of this function is `O(exp(x0^2))`. This growth rate is faster than any polynomial and even faster than `exp(x0)`.\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"The given expression simplifies to `1.29095383225845 * exp(x0^2 * 0.01533383)`. We assume 'K' in 'when K is large' refers to 'x0', as 'x0' is the only variable in the expression and this interpretation aligns with the request for a complexity analysis. Let `f(x0) = 1.29095383225845 * exp(x0^2 * 0.01533383)`. As `|x0|` (the absolute value of x0) becomes large, `x0^2` becomes large and positive. Since the coefficient `0.01533383` is positive, the exponent `x0^2 * 0.01533383` also becomes large and positive. Consequently, `exp(x0^2 * 0.01533383)` grows without bound. The least upper bound for a function that grows without bound is the function itself, as no tighter function can bound it from above without eventually being surpassed by the original function. The formula is an exponential function, as required.\",\n    \"type_of_equation\": \"exponential\",\n    \"llm_upper_bound\": \"1.29095383225845 * exp(x0^2 * 0.01533383)\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.95,\n    \"complexity\": \"O(exp(x0^2))\"\n}\n```"
