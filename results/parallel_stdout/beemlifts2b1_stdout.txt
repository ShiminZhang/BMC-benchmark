Given that the expression contains `x0` and a formula is expected, the most reasonable interpretation is that `x0` is the variable that is becoming large (i.e., `x0 -> infinity`), and 'K' is either a general reference to the variable in question or a slight misphrasing for `x0`.\\n\\n3.  **The function**: Based on the above, the function to analyze is `f(x0) = -0.9243703 / (x0 ^ 2.1714964)`.\\n\\n4.  **Domain for `x0`**: For `x0 ^ 2.1714964` to be well-defined in real numbers, `x0` must be positive.

Therefore, `f(x0) = -0.9243703 / (positive number)` is always negative. This means `f(x0) < 0` for all `x0 > 0`.
