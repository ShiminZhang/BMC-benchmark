The formula should be either an exponential or a polynomial function with an integer exponent. The user also specified that `X^K` with `K<=1` is considered linear, not polynomial, which is a non-standard classification (linear functions are a subset of polynomial functions).\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"1.  **Analyze the given expression**: The expression is `f(x0) = 6.5492764e - 5 * x0`. Let `C = 6.5492764e - 5`. So, `f(x0) = C * x0`. This is a linear function of `x0`. According to standard mathematical definitions, a linear function is a polynomial of degree 1 (since `x0` has an integer exponent of 1). The user's specific instruction 'X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!' implies they want to distinguish linear from higher-degree polynomials, but it still falls under the 'polynomial function with integer exponent' category. \\n2.  **Context of 'K is large'**: The variable `K` does not appear in the expression. This phrase likely sets the context for asymptotic analysis, where we consider the behavior of the function as `x0` (or the input size) becomes large. In complexity theory, we typically assume `x0 >= 0`.\\n3.  **Least Upper Bound Formula**: In complexity theory, the 'least upper bound formula' usually refers to the tightest asymptotic upper bound, often represented by the simplest function `g(x0)` such that `f(x0) = O(g(x0))`. \\n    *   For `f(x0) = C * x0`, where `C` is a positive constant, the asymptotic upper bound is `O(x0)`. \\n    *   The formula representing this asymptotic class is `x0`. \\n4.  **Verification of `x0` as an upper bound**: Since `C = 6.5492764e - 5` is a positive constant less than 1, for any `x0 >= 0`, we have `C * x0 <= x0`. Therefore, `x0` is indeed an upper bound for `C * x0` when `x0 >= 0`.\\n5.  **Verification of `x0` as the 'least' upper bound**: \\n    *   Any function `h(x0)` that grows asymptotically slower than `x0` (e.g., `log(x0)`, `sqrt(x0)`) would eventually be smaller than `C * x0` for large `x0`, and thus would not be an upper bound. \\n    *   Any function `h(x0)` that grows asymptotically faster than `x0` (e.g., `x0^2`, `e^x0`) would be an upper bound, but it would not be the *least* one, as `x0` itself is a tighter upper bound. \\n    *   Therefore, `x0` is the least upper bound in terms of asymptotic growth rate.\\n6.  **Formula type**: `x0` is a polynomial function with an integer exponent (1), satisfying the requirement.\\n7.  **Example `x + 5`**: The provided example `llm_upper_bound\": \"x + 5\"` is somewhat ambiguous. If the original function was `x`, then `x` is the least upper bound, not `x+5`. If the original function was `x-C'` for some `C'>0`, then `x+5` might be a general upper bound. However, for `C * x0` with `C < 1` and `x0 >= 0`, `x0` is a tighter and more standard asymptotic upper bound than `x0 + B` for any `B > 0`. Given the context of complexity theory, simplifying constants and focusing on the dominant term is standard practice.\",\n    \"type_of_equation\": \"linear\",\n    \"llm_upper_bound\": \"x0\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.9,\n    \"complexity\": \"O(x0)\"\n}\n```"
