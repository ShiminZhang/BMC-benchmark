It must be 'either an exponential function or a polynomial function with integer exponent'.\\n2.  Crucially, the prompt states: 'X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!'. This means that a function like `x0^1` (which is `x0`) is explicitly excluded from being considered a 'polynomial function' in the context of the required output type.
