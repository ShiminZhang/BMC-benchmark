The expression is `f(x0) = C * x0`. This is a linear function.\\n\\n1.  **Analyze the given equation**: The equation is `f(x0) = C * x0`, where `C` is a positive constant. This is a linear function of `x0`.\\n\\n2.  **Least upper bound formula**: For a function `f(x)`, the least upper bound formula is the tightest possible function `g(x)` such that `f(x) <= g(x)` for all `x` in the domain.
