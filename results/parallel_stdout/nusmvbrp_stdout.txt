Therefore, `* * 2` should be interpreted as `**2`, meaning `x0` raised to the power of 2. So the expression is `1.695565e - 8 * x0^2`.\\n2.  **Identify the constant**: `1.695565e - 8` is a positive constant, let's call it `C`. So the expression is `C * x0^2`.\\n3.  **Interpret 'when K is large'**: The variable `K` is not directly present in the expression `C * x0^2`. However, the question asks for the upper bound 'when K is large', which implies that `K` is the variable whose growth we are analyzing, or `x0` is a function of `K`. The most common and reasonable interpretation in complexity theory when a variable is mentioned in the condition but not in the formula is that the variable in the formula (`x0` here) should be replaced by the variable in the condition (`K`). Thus, we assume `x0 = K` for the purpose of finding the upper bound with respect to `K`.\\n4.  **Formulate the expression in terms of K**: Substituting `x0 = K`, the expression becomes `C * K^2`.\\n5.  **Determine the least upper bound formula**: For a function `f(K) = C * K^2`, where `C` is a positive constant, the least upper bound (asymptotic behavior) is determined by the highest degree term. This is a polynomial function of degree 2. The least upper bound formula, ignoring constant factors as is common in Big-O notation but providing a function as requested, is `K^2`.\\n6.  **Determine the type of equation**: `K^2` is a polynomial function with an integer exponent (2).\\n7.  **Determine the complexity**: The complexity of `K^2` is `O(K^2)`.\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"The given expression is `1.695565e - 8 * x0 * * 2`.
