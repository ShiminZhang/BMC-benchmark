The formula must be either an exponential or a polynomial function with an integer exponent. The problem also provides a clarification: 'X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!'. This clarification seems to refer to a variable 'X' and an exponent 'K', which is a bit confusing given the context of bounding a constant number with respect to a variable 'K'.\\n\\n1.  **Identify the function to be bounded:** The value given is 5.24. This is a constant. Let's define a function f(K) = 5.24, as the upper bound formula is expected to be a function of K.\\n\\n2.  **Determine the least upper bound:** For a constant function f(K) = C, the least upper bound is C itself.

A constant function can be expressed as a polynomial of degree 0. Specifically, C * K^0 = C. Therefore, 5.24 * K**0 is a polynomial function with an integer exponent (0).\\n\\n4.  **Address the clarification 'X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!':** This statement is generally about classifying functions of a variable 'X' where 'K' is a constant exponent. If K=0, X^0=1 (constant, which is a polynomial of degree 0). If K=1, X^1=X (linear, which is a polynomial of degree 1). So, the statement 'not polynomial!' is incorrect for K=0,1.

Since 5.24 <= 5.24, it is an upper bound.
