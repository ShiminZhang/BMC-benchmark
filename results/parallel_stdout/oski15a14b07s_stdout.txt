So the function is `f(x0) = C * x0`. This is a linear function. In complexity theory, 'least upper bound' refers to the tightest asymptotic upper bound, typically expressed using Big-O notation. For a linear function `C * x0`, the tightest asymptotic bound is `O(x0)`. The question asks for a 'formula' that is an upper bound and should be either an exponential or a polynomial function with an integer exponent. Since `C` is a positive constant less than 1 (`C < 1`), for any `x0 > 0` (which is the typical domain for complexity analysis), we have `C * x0 <= x0`. Therefore, `g(x0) = x0` serves as a concrete upper bound formula. This formula `x0` is a polynomial function with an integer exponent of 1. It is the 'least' upper bound because `f(x0)` is `Theta(x0)`, and `g(x0) = x0` is also `Theta(x0)`. Any function growing asymptotically slower than `x0` would not be an upper bound, and any function growing asymptotically faster would not be the *least* upper bound. The phrase 'when K is large' reinforces the context of asymptotic analysis where `x0` is assumed to be large.
