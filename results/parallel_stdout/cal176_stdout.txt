First, I need to correctly interpret the expression. The user explicitly states `** means power 2**2 is 2^2`. This implies that `* * 2` should be interpreted as `^2`. Therefore, the expression is `7.7374167 * x0^2`. The variable in question is `x0`. The phrase 'when K is large' is not directly applicable to the given expression as 'K' is not present as a variable or exponent. I will treat it as a general context or a red herring for this specific problem. The expression `f(x0) = 7.7374167 * x0^2` is a quadratic function, which is a type of polynomial function. In complexity theory, the least upper bound (asymptotic upper bound) for a polynomial function `P(x) = a_n x^n + ... + a_0` is `O(x^n)`. For `f(x0) = 7.7374167 * x0^2`, the highest degree term is `x0^2`. Thus, the least upper bound in Big-O notation is `O(x0^2)`. The question asks for a 'formula' (e.g., 'x + 5'), not just the Big-O notation. The simplest polynomial function that represents this asymptotic growth is `x0^2`. This fits the requirement of being a 'polynomial function with integer exponent' (exponent is 2). The exponent 2 is greater than 1, so it is correctly classified as polynomial, not linear, as per the user's clarification. To explain why it's an upper bound, I will use the definition of Big-O notation: `f(x) = O(g(x))` if there exist positive constants `C` and `x_0` such that `|f(x)| <= C * |g(x)|` for all `x >= x_0`. For `f(x0) = 7.7374167 * x0^2` and `g(x0) = x0^2`, we can choose `C = 7.7374167` and `x_0 = 1` (assuming `x0` is non-negative, which is standard in complexity analysis). Then `|7.7374167 * x0^2| <= 7.7374167 * |x0^2|` holds true for all `x0 >= 1`.
