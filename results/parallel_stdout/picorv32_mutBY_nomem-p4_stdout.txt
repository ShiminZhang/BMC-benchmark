The `**` notation means exponentiation. So, the expression is `(x0^(0.10231167) - 2.5822142) * (x0^(-0.089870123015955) + 7.5545235)`. \\n\\nLet's define the constants and exponents:\\n`a = 0.10231167`\\n`b = -0.089870123015955`\\n`C1 = 2.5822142`\\n`C2 = 7.5545235`\\n\\nThe expression becomes `(x0^a - C1) * (x0^b + C2)`. Expanding this product:\\n`x0^a * x0^b + x0^a * C2 - C1 * x0^b - C1 * C2`\\nUsing exponent rules (`x^m * x^n = x^(m+n)`):\\n`x0^(a+b) + C2 * x0^a - C1 * x0^b - C1 * C2`\\n\\nNow, let's calculate `a+b`:\\n`a+b = 0.10231167 + (-0.089870123015955) = 0.10231167 - 0.089870123015955 = 0.012441546984045`\\n\\nThe full expanded expression is:\\n`f(x0) = x0^(0.012441546984045) + 7.5545235 * x0^(0.10231167) - 2.5822142 * x0^(-0.089870123015955) - (2.5822142 * 7.5545235)`\\n`f(x0) = x0^(0.012441546984045) + 7.5545235 * x0^(0.10231167) - 2.5822142 * x0^(-0.089870123015955) - 19.5076137`\\n\\nThe problem states \"when K is large\". Since `K` is not present in the formula, it's a reasonable assumption that `x0` is the variable that is considered large, as is standard in complexity analysis. We need to find the least upper bound for `f(x0)` as `x0` tends to infinity.\\n\\nWe compare the exponents of `x0` in the terms that grow or remain constant:\\n1. `0.012441546984045` (from `x0^(a+b)`) \\n2. `0.10231167` (from `C2 * x0^a`)\\n3. `-0.089870123015955` (from `-C1 * x0^b`, this term goes to 0 as `x0` grows)\\n4. Constant term `-19.5076137` (negligible for large `x0`)\\n\\nThe largest positive exponent is `0.10231167`. Therefore, the term `7.5545235 * x0^(0.10231167)` will dominate the expression for large `x0`.\\n\\nThe \"least upper bound formula\" typically refers to the dominant term, including its coefficient, as it provides the tightest asymptotic bound.\\nSo, the `llm_upper_bound` is `7.5545235 * x0^(0.10231167)`.\\n\\nFor `type_of_equation`, the problem provides a specific definition: \\\"X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!\\\". In our dominant term `x0^(0.10231167)`, the exponent `K = 0.10231167`. Since `0.10231167 <= 1`, according to this definition, the equation type is \"linear\".\\n\\nFor `complexity`, we use standard Big O notation. The growth rate is determined by the dominant term `x0^(0.10231167)`. So, the complexity is `O(x0^(0.10231167))`. The special definition for \"linear\" classification does not change the precise Big O notation for the growth rate.\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"The given expression is `f(x0) = (x0^(0.10231167) - 2.5822142) * (x0^(-0.089870123015955) + 7.5545235)`. \\n\\nExpanding this product yields:\\n`f(x0) = x0^(0.10231167 + (-0.089870123015955)) + 7.5545235 * x0^(0.10231167) - 2.5822142 * x0^(-0.089870123015955) - (2.5822142 * 7.5545235)`\\n`f(x0) = x0^(0.012441546984045) + 7.5545235 * x0^(0.10231167) - 2.5822142 * x0^(-0.089870123015955) - 19.5076137`\\n\\nWhen `x0` is large, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of each term:\\n1.  `x0^(0.012441546984045)`: This term grows as `x0` increases.\\n2.  `7.5545235 * x0^(0.10231167)`: This term also grows as `x0` increases.\\n3.  `-2.5822142 * x0^(-0.089870123015955)`: Since the exponent is negative, this term approaches `0` as `x0` becomes large (`-2.5822142 / x0^(0.089870123015955)`).\\n4.  `-19.5076137`: This is a constant term.\\n\\nTo find the dominant term, we compare the positive exponents: `0.012441546984045` and `0.10231167`.
