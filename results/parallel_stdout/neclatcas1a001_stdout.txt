The phrase 'when K is large' is extraneous as `K` does not appear in the expression and thus does not influence its form or behavior. The request asks for the 'least upper bound formula'.

This is a linear function of `x0`, where `2.786345e - 7` is a positive constant coefficient. Let this coefficient be `C`. So, the function is `f(x0) = C * x0`.\n    2.  **Determine the least upper bound:** For any function `f(x0)`, its least upper bound `g(x0)` is a function such that `f(x0) <= g(x0)` for all relevant `x0`, and no function `h(x0)` that grows strictly slower than `g(x0)` can also serve as an upper bound. For a linear function `f(x0) = C * x0` with `C > 0`, the function itself is its own least upper bound. That is, `g(x0) = C * x0`. This satisfies `f(x0) <= g(x0)` because `C * x0 = C * x0`. No function growing asymptotically slower than `C * x0` (e.g., a constant or `log(x0)`) can be an upper bound for `C * x0` for all `x0`.\n    3.  **Check formula type constraints:** The prompt states the formula should be 'an exponential function or a polynomial function with integer exponent'. `C * x0` is a polynomial function of degree 1 (with integer exponent 1). This fits the requirement.\n    4.  **Classify the type of equation:** The prompt provides a specific rule: 'X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!'. Since our upper bound `C * x0` has `x0` raised to the power of 1, according to this rule, it should be classified as 'linear'.\n    5.  **Analyze complexity:** The asymptotic complexity of a linear function `C * x0` is `O(x0)`.\n    6.  **Irrelevance of K:** The variable `K` is mentioned as 'large' but does not appear in the given expression `2.786345e - 7 * x0`. Therefore, it is not relevant to determining the upper bound of this specific expression.\",\n    \"type_of_equation\": \"linear\",\n    \"llm_upper_bound\": \"2.786345e - 7 * x0\",\n    \"confidence\": 1.0,\n    \"complexity\": \"O(x0)\"\n}\n```"
