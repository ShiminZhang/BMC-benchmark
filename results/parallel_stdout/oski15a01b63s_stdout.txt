The problem states `** means power 2**2 is 2^2`, indicating `**` is the exponentiation operator. Given this, `* *` is most likely a typo for `**`. There are two plausible interpretations for `x0 * * 0.13424236`:\\n1.  `x0**2 * 0.13424236`: `x0` squared, multiplied by the constant `0.13424236`.\\n2.  `x0**0.13424236`: `x0` raised to the power of `0.13424236`.\\n\\nLet's analyze both interpretations.

Therefore, `exp(B * x0^2) -> infinity`. The product `x0^2 * exp(B * x0^2)` tends to `infinity`. Since `A` is negative, `f(x0)` tends to `-infinity`.\\n*   **Finding extrema:**\\n    *   Let's find the derivative with respect to `x0`:\\n        `f'(x0) = A * [2 * x0 * exp(B * x0^2) + x0^2 * exp(B * x0^2) * (2 * B * x0)]`\\n        `f'(x0) = 2 * A * x0 * exp(B * x0^2) * (1 + B * x0^2)`\\n    *   Set `f'(x0) = 0`:\\n        Since `A != 0`, `exp(B * x0^2) > 0`, and `(1 + B * x0^2) > 0` (because `B > 0` and `x0^2 >= 0`), the only way for `f'(x0) = 0` is if `x0 = 0`.\\n    *   Evaluate `f(0)`: `f(0) = A * 0^2 * exp(B * 0^2) = 0`.\\n*   **Nature of the extremum:**\\n    *   The sign of `f'(x0)` is determined by `2 * A * x0`. Since `A < 0`, the sign of `f'(x0)` is determined by `-x0`.\\n    *   If `x0 > 0`, `f'(x0) < 0` (function is decreasing).\\n    *   If `x0 < 0`, `f'(x0) > 0` (function is increasing).\\n    *   This means `x0 = 0` is a local maximum. Given that the function tends to `-infinity` at both ends, `f(0) = 0` is the global maximum.\\n\\n**Interpretation 2: `f(x0) = - C1 * x0^C2 * exp(x0^C2)`**\\nLet `A = -C1` (negative constant). Let `y = x0^C2`. Since `C2 = 0.13424236` is a fractional exponent, `x0` must be non-negative for real values, so `y >= 0`.\\nThe function becomes `g(y) = A * y * exp(y)`.\\n\\n*   **Asymptotic behavior:**\\n    *   As `y -> infinity` (i.e., `x0 -> infinity`), `y * exp(y) -> infinity`. Since `A` is negative, `g(y)` tends to `-infinity`.\\n    *   As `y -> 0` (i.e., `x0 -> 0`), `g(y) -> A * 0 * exp(0) = 0`.\\n*   **Finding extrema:**\\n    *   Let's find the derivative with respect to `y`:\\n        `g'(y) = A * [1 * exp(y) + y * exp(y)] = A * exp(y) * (1 + y)`\\n    *   Set `g'(y) = 0`:\\n        Since `A != 0` and `exp(y) > 0`, we must have `1 + y = 0`, which means `y = -1`. However, `y` must be non-negative (`y >= 0`). So there are no critical points in the domain `y >= 0`.\\n*   **Nature of the extremum:**\\n    *   For `y > 0`, `1 + y > 0`. Since `A < 0` and `exp(y) > 0`, `g'(y) < 0`. This means the function is strictly decreasing for `y > 0`.\\n    *   The maximum value must occur at the boundary `y = 0`. `g(0) = 0`.\\n\\n**Conclusion:** Both plausible interpretations of the ambiguous notation lead to the same least upper bound: `0`.\\n\\n**\"When K is large\"**: K is not present in the function. If it refers to a domain constraint (e.g., `x0` in `[-K, K]`), the global maximum at `x0=0` (which is `0`) would still be the least upper bound. If it's a general context for complexity, it doesn't change the upper bound value.\\n\\n**Type of equation:** The presence of `exp(...)` makes it an exponential function.\\n\\n**Complexity of the upper bound formula:** The upper bound is `0`, which is a constant.
