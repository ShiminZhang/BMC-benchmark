The formula must be either an exponential function or a polynomial function with an integer exponent. A crucial constraint is provided: `X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!`. This means that a linear function like `C * x0` (which is `x0^1`) is explicitly excluded from being classified as a 'polynomial' in this context.\\n\\nLet's analyze the given expression: `f(x0) = 3.3597075e - 7 * x0`. This can be written as `f(x0) = C * x0`, where `C = 3.3597075 * 10^-7` is a small positive constant.\\n\\n1.  **Identify the nature of the expression:** `f(x0) = C * x0` is a linear function of `x0`.\\n2.  **Address the 'polynomial' constraint:** According to the user's definition, `x0^1` is linear, not polynomial. Therefore, if we choose a polynomial function as the upper bound, its integer exponent must be `k >= 2`.\\n3.  **Address the 'least upper bound' requirement:** We need the tightest possible upper bound from the allowed function types (polynomials with `k >= 2` or exponential functions).\\n    *   **Consider polynomial functions (degree >= 2):**\\n        *   The simplest polynomial with an integer exponent `k >= 2` is `x0^2`. Let's check if `x0^2` is an upper bound for `C * x0`. For `x0 > C` (i.e., `x0 > 3.3597075 * 10^-7`), we have `C * x0 < x0^2`. Since `x0` is typically considered large in complexity analysis, this condition holds for sufficiently large `x0`. Thus, `x0^2` is an upper bound.\\n        *   Other polynomials like `x0^3`, `x0^4`, etc., would also be upper bounds, but `x0^2` grows slower than any `x0^k` for `k > 2`.
