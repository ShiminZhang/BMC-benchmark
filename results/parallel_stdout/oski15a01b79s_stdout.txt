Let's call this constant $C$. The `* *` notation means power, so `x0 * * 1.121162` means $x_0^{1.121162}$. Thus, the expression is $f(x_0) = C \\cdot x_0^{1.121162}$.\\n2.  **Address 'when K is large'**: K is not present in the expression. It's reasonable to assume this refers to the variable $x_0$ becoming large, which is standard for upper bound analysis in complexity theory.\\n3.  **Interpret 'least upper bound formula' with constraints**: The problem asks for the 'least upper bound formula' but then imposes a crucial constraint: 'the formula should either be an exponential function or a polynomial function with integer exponent. X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!'.\\n4.  **Analyze the original function type**: The original function $f(x_0) = C \\cdot x_0^{1.121162}$ has a non-integer exponent ($1.121162$).\\n    *   It's not 'linear' because the exponent $1.121162 > 1$.\\n    *   It's not 'polynomial' because the exponent is not an integer.\\n    *   It's not 'exponential' (which would be of the form $a^{x_0}$). \\n    Therefore, the original function itself does not fit the required output format for the `llm_upper_bound` field.\\n5.  **Find the 'least' upper bound that fits the format**: We need to find the tightest possible upper bound $g(x_0)$ such that $f(x_0) \\le g(x_0)$ for sufficiently large $x_0$, and $g(x_0)$ is either an exponential function or a polynomial function with an integer exponent.\\n    *   **Consider polynomial functions with integer exponents**: Let $g(x_0) = A \\cdot x_0^k$ where $k$ is an integer. We need $x_0^{1.121162} \\le x_0^k$ for large $x_0$. For $x_0 > 1$, this implies $1.121162 \\le k$. The smallest integer $k$ satisfying this condition is $k=2$. So, $C \\cdot x_0^2$ is a polynomial upper bound with an integer exponent. This is the 'least' such polynomial upper bound.\\n    *   **Consider exponential functions**: An exponential function like $C \\cdot e^{x_0}$ or $C \\cdot 2^{x_0}$ would also be an upper bound. However, exponential functions grow much faster than any polynomial function (e.g., $e^{x_0}$ grows much faster than $x_0^2$, which in turn grows faster than $x_0^{1.121162}$). Therefore, $C \\cdot x_0^2$ is a significantly tighter (and thus 'leaster') upper bound than any exponential function.\\n6.  **Conclusion for `llm_upper_bound`**: The least upper bound that satisfies the format constraint is $C \\cdot x_0^2 = (3.6017624 \\times 10^{-8}) \\cdot x_0^2$.\\n7.  **Determine `type_of_equation` for the chosen upper bound**: The chosen upper bound is $C \\cdot x_0^2$. The exponent $2$ is an integer and $2 > 1$. According to the problem's definition ('polynomial function with integer exponent. X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!'), this qualifies as a 'polynomial' function.\\n8.  **Determine `complexity`**: The complexity of $C \\cdot x_0^2$ is $O(x_0^2)$.\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"The given expression is $f(x_0) = (3.6017624 \\times 10^{-8}) \\cdot x_0^{1.121162}$. The problem asks for the 'least upper bound formula' but specifies that the formula must be either an exponential function or a polynomial function with an integer exponent. The original function has a non-integer exponent ($1.121162$), so it does not fit these categories directly.\\n\\nTo find the 'least' upper bound that fits the specified format:\\n1.  **Polynomial Upper Bound**: We look for the smallest integer exponent $k$ such that $x_0^{1.121162} \\le x_0^k$ for sufficiently large $x_0$ (assuming $x_0 > 1$). The smallest integer $k$ that satisfies $1.121162 \\le k$ is $k=2$. Thus, $(3.6017624 \\times 10^{-8}) \\cdot x_0^2$ is the least polynomial upper bound with an integer exponent.\\n2.  **Exponential Upper Bound**: Any exponential function (e.g., $e^{x_0}$) grows significantly faster than any polynomial function for large $x_0$. Therefore, a polynomial upper bound like $x_0^2$ is much tighter than any exponential upper bound.\\n\\nGiven the constraint, the least upper bound that fits the required format is $(3.6017624 \\times 10^{-8}) \\cdot x_0^2$. This is a polynomial function because its exponent (2) is an integer greater than 1, as per the problem's definition. The complexity of this function is $O(x_0^2)$.\",\n    \"type_of_equation\": \"polynomial\",\n    \"llm_upper_bound\": \"3.6017624e-8 * x0**2\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.95,\n    \"complexity\": \"O(x0^2)\"\n}\n```"
