The prompt explicitly states: \\\"** means power 2**2 is 2^2.\\\" This strongly indicates that `* * 2` should be interpreted as `**2`, meaning `x^2`.

This phrase might be a general context for complexity analysis, or a leftover from a different problem. Since `K` is not a variable in the expression, the upper bound will be in terms of `x0`.\\n6.  **Determine the least upper bound formula**: For a function `f(x) = C * x^2` (where `C` is a positive constant), the function itself is the tightest (least) upper bound for positive `x` as `x` approaches infinity.

Any function `g(x0)` such that `f(x0) <= g(x0)` for sufficiently large `x0` is an upper bound.
