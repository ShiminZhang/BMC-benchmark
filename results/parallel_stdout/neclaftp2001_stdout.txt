This is a linear function of `x0`. The problem asks for the 'least upper bound formula' when 'K is large'.

In complexity theory, the least upper bound for a function `f(x0) = C * x0` (where `C > 0`) is `Theta(x0)`, which implies `O(x0)`. The question requires the formula to be an 'exponential function or a polynomial function with integer exponent'. `x0` (which is `x0^1`) is a polynomial function with an integer exponent (1).
