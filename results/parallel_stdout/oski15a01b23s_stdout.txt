The formula must be either an exponential or a polynomial function with integer exponent, and `X^K` with `K<=1` is considered linear, not polynomial. The output must be in a specific JSON format.\\n\\nFirst, let's clarify the expression: `3.518697e - 7 * x0` can be written as `(3.518697 * 10^-7) - (7 * x0)`. Let `C1 = 3.518697 * 10^-7` and `C2 = 7`. So the function is `f(x0) = C1 - C2 * x0`.\\n\\nThe phrase 'when K is large' is given, but `K` is not present in the expression. I will assume `K` is a general context for complexity theory problems, implying that we should consider the behavior for large values of `x0` (typically `x0 >= 0`). If `K` was intended to be an exponent for `x0`, the expression would be `x0^K`, which is not the case.\\n\\nNow, let's find the 'least upper bound formula' for `f(x0) = C1 - C2 * x0`.\\n1.  **Domain Assumption**: In complexity theory, variables like `x0` (representing input size, etc.) are typically non-negative. So, we consider the domain `x0 >= 0`.\\n2.  **Function Behavior**: `f(x0) = C1 - C2 * x0` is a linear function with a negative slope (`-C2 = -7`). This means `f(x0)` is a strictly decreasing function for `x0 >= 0`.\\n3.  **Maximum Value**: For a strictly decreasing function on the domain `[0, infinity)`, its maximum value (and thus its least upper bound) occurs at the smallest value in the domain, which is `x0 = 0`.\\n4.  **Calculate Upper Bound**: `f(0) = C1 - C2 * 0 = C1`. So, `f(x0) <= C1` for all `x0 >= 0`.\\n5.  **Least Upper Bound**: `C1` is an upper bound. To confirm it's the *least* upper bound, consider any value `C1 - epsilon` where `epsilon > 0`. Since `f(0) = C1`, `C1 - epsilon` cannot be an upper bound because `f(0)` is greater than `C1 - epsilon`. Therefore, `C1` is the least upper bound.\\n\\nNext, classify the upper bound `C1 = 3.518697e-7` according to the given rules:\\n1.  `C1` is a constant value.\\n2.  A constant can be expressed as a polynomial of degree 0 (e.g., `C1 * x0^0`). The exponent `0` is an integer.\\n3.  The problem states: 'X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!'. This explicitly classifies polynomials of degree 0 (`x^0`) and degree 1 (`x^1`) as 'linear'.\\n4.  Therefore, the `type_of_equation` for `C1` is 'linear'.\\n\\nFinally, determine the complexity of the upper bound:\\n1.
