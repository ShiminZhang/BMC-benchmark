The formula must be either exponential or polynomial with integer exponents. I need to analyze the asymptotic behavior of the function.\\n\\nThe given function is: \\n`f(x0) = 1.13425406776093 * exp(1.34044919252015 * exp( - exp(6.7099585e - 8 * x0))) * exp(0.9987014 * exp(exp(6.7099585e - 8 * x0)))`\\n\\nLet's define the constants for clarity:\\n`C1 = 1.13425406776093`\\n`C2 = 1.34044919252015`\\n`C3 = 0.9987014`\\n`alpha = 6.7099585e - 8`\\n\\nThe function can be rewritten as:\\n`f(x0) = C1 * exp(C2 * exp(-exp(alpha * x0))) * exp(C3 * exp(exp(alpha * x0)))`\\n\\nLet's analyze the behavior of the terms as `x0` becomes large (approaches infinity):\\n\\n1.  **Innermost term:** `alpha * x0`. As `x0 -> infinity`, `alpha * x0 -> infinity` (since `alpha > 0`).\\n\\n2.  **Intermediate term:** `exp(alpha * x0)`. As `x0 -> infinity`, `exp(alpha * x0) -> infinity`. Let `y = exp(alpha * x0)`. So, `y -> infinity` as `x0 -> infinity`.\\n\\n3.  **First main exponential factor:** `exp(C2 * exp(-exp(alpha * x0)))`\\n    This can be written as `exp(C2 * exp(-y))`. \\n    As `y -> infinity`, `exp(-y) -> 0`. \\n    So, `C2 * exp(-y) -> C2 * 0 = 0`. \\n    Therefore, `exp(C2 * exp(-y)) -> exp(0) = 1`. \\n    This entire factor approaches a constant value of 1 for large `x0`.\\n\\n4.  **Second main exponential factor:** `exp(C3 * exp(exp(alpha * x0)))`\\n    This can be written as `exp(C3 * exp(y))`. \\n    As `y -> infinity`, `exp(y) -> infinity`. \\n    So, `C3 * exp(y) -> infinity` (since `C3 > 0`). \\n    Therefore, `exp(C3 * exp(y)) -> infinity`. \\n    This factor grows extremely rapidly.\\n\\n5.  **Overall function behavior:**\\n    For large `x0`, `f(x0)` is approximately:\\n    `f(x0) ~ C1 * 1 * exp(C3 * exp(exp(alpha * x0)))`\\n    `f(x0) ~ C1 * exp(C3 * exp(exp(alpha * x0)))`\\n\\nThis is the dominant term and represents the asymptotic growth of the function.
