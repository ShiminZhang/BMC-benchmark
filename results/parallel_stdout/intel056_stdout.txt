First, I need to correctly interpret this expression. `1.3415554e - 7` is a constant, which can be written as `1.3415554 * 10^-7`. The `* *` operator indicates exponentiation, so `x0 * * 1.070247` means `x0^(1.070247)`. Thus, the expression is `C * x0^(1.070247)`, where `C = 1.3415554 * 10^-7`. \\n\\nThe problem asks for the 'least upper bound formula' and specifies that 'the formula should either be an exponential function or a polynomial function with integer exponent'.\\n\\n1.  **Analyze the function type**: The expression `C * x0^(1.070247)` is a power function. Since the exponent `1.070247` is greater than 1, it exhibits polynomial-like growth. The problem statement clarifies that 'X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!', implying that exponents greater than 1 are considered polynomial.

For `x0 > 1`, if `m >= p`, then `x0^m >= x0^p`. The smallest integer `m` that is greater than or equal to `1.070247` is `2`. Therefore, `x0^2` is the least upper bound in the form of a polynomial with an integer exponent.\\n\\n3.  **Construct the upper bound formula**: Including the constant `C`, the least upper bound formula that fits the specified format is `1.3415554e - 7 * x0^2`.\\n\\n4.  **Address 'K is large'**: The variable `K` is not present in the given expression.
