First, I need to parse this expression correctly. `6.77507e - 11` is a constant, which can be written as `C = 6.77507 * 10^-11`. The `* * 2` part is clarified by the user: `** means power 2**2 is 2^2`. This means `* * 2` should be interpreted as `^2`. So, the expression becomes `C * x0^2`.

This is a polynomial function of degree 2. The phrase 'when K is large' does not introduce `K` into the expression itself; it's a common context for complexity analysis, implying we are interested in the asymptotic behavior as the input variable (`x`) grows large. For a polynomial function `f(x) = C * x^2` where `C` is a positive constant, the least upper bound in complexity theory (Big-O notation) is `O(x^2)`. The formula for this upper bound, typically dropping constant factors, is `x^2`. This fits the requirement of being a polynomial function with an integer exponent. The constant `C` is positive, so the function grows quadratically. `x^2` is an upper bound because `C * x^2 <= x^2` for all `x >= 0` since `C` is a positive constant less than 1. It's the *least* upper bound because no function with a strictly lower growth rate (e.g., `x`, `log x`, `1`) can bound `C * x^2` for all sufficiently large `x`.
