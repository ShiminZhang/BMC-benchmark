Let's denote the constant `C = 9.37520439947548e - 7`. The expression is `C * x0`. The variable is `x0`. The phrase 'when K is large' is noted, but `K` does not appear in the given expression.

This is a linear function of `x0` because `C` is a constant and `x0` is raised to the power of 1.\\n\\n2.  **Least upper bound formula**: In complexity theory and mathematics, the least upper bound (or supremum) of a function `f(x)` is often `f(x)` itself when we are looking for a tight functional bound.

The formula `C * x0` is a polynomial function with an integer exponent (1 for `x0`). So, it fits this requirement.\\n\\n5.  **Explanation for upper bound**: `C * x0` is an upper bound for itself because `C * x0 <= C * x0` is always true. It is the *least* upper bound because for any function `g(x0)` that is strictly less than `C * x0` for some `x0` (assuming `C > 0` and `x0` can be arbitrarily large), `g(x0)` cannot be an upper bound for all `x0`.\\n\\n6.  **Complexity**: The complexity of a linear function `C * x0` is `O(x0)` (or `O(x)` using a generic variable name).\\n\\n7.  **Confidence**: High, as the interpretation aligns with standard mathematical definitions and the specific (though slightly unusual) instructions regarding 'linear' vs 'polynomial'.
