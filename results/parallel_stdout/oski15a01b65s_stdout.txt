So, the expression is `9.7451405e-8 * x0 ** 1.0777433`. Let `C = 9.7451405e-8` and `alpha = 1.0777433`. The expression is `C * x0^alpha`. The problem states 'when K is large'. Since `K` is not explicitly in the expression, and `x0` is the only variable, it is standard in complexity theory to assume `x0` represents the input size, which we denote as `K` (or `n`). Thus, we are analyzing the function `f(K) = C * K^alpha = C * K^1.0777433` as `K` approaches infinity.\\n\\n1.  **Identify the function type:** The function is a power function `K^alpha`. The exponent `alpha = 1.0777433` is a constant greater than 1. The user's statement 'X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!' implies that if the exponent is greater than 1, it is considered polynomial. Since `1.0777433 > 1`, the function `K^1.0777433` is a polynomial function.\\n\\n2.  **Address the 'integer exponent' constraint:** The problem explicitly states 'the formula should either be an exponential function or a polynomial function with integer exponent.' The exponent `1.0777433` is not an integer. To find the *least upper bound* that satisfies the integer exponent constraint, we need to find the smallest integer `j` such that `K^1.0777433 = O(K^j)`. This means `j` must be greater than or equal to `1.0777433`. The smallest integer `j` that satisfies this condition is `ceil(1.0777433) = 2`.\\n\\n3.  **Determine the least upper bound formula:** Based on the above, the least upper bound with an integer exponent is `K^2`. The constant `C` is absorbed into the Big-O notation.\\n\\n4.  **Analyze complexity:** The complexity of the upper bound formula `K^2` is `O(K^2)`.\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"The given expression is `9.7451405e-8 * x0 ** 1.0777433`.
