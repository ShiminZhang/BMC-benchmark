The `K` in 'when K is large' is a general context for asymptotic analysis, implying we consider the behavior as the variable `x0` becomes large. The `K` is not part of the expression itself. The expression can be written as `(1.7165105 * 10^-5) * x0`. Let `C = 1.7165105 * 10^-5`. The expression is `C * x0`.\\n\\nThis is a linear function of `x0`. In complexity theory, the least upper bound for a function `f(x) = C * x` (where `C` is a positive constant) is `f(x)` itself, or asymptotically `O(x)`.\\n\\nThe user has specific constraints for the `llm_upper_bound` formula and `type_of_equation`:\\n1. The formula should either be an exponential function or a polynomial function with an integer exponent.\\n2. `X^K` with `K<=1` is still linear, not polynomial.\\n\\nThis creates a potential conflict. If `C * x0` is linear (as per the user's definition, since the exponent of `x0` is 1), and linear functions are explicitly stated as *not* polynomial, then `C * x0` would not fit the criteria of being 'exponential' or 'polynomial with integer exponent (where exponent > 1)'.\\n\\nHowever, the user's example for `llm_upper_bound` is `\\\"x + 5\\\"`, which is a linear function. This strongly suggests that linear functions *are* acceptable as `llm_upper_bound` formulas, especially when the original function itself is linear. The constraint likely means that if the function is, for example, `x^2`, the upper bound should be `x^2` (polynomial), and if it's `2^x`, the upper bound should be `2^x` (exponential). If the function is linear, the least upper bound is linear.\\n\\nTherefore, I will interpret the constraints as follows:\\n- The `type_of_equation` for `C * x0` is 'linear' based on the user's definition (`X^K` with `K<=1` is linear).\\n- The `llm_upper_bound` should be the tightest possible bound, and if that bound is linear, it is acceptable, consistent with the user's own example `\\\"x + 5\\\"`.\\n\\n**Equation Analysis:**\\nThe given equation is `1.7165105e - 5 * x0`.

It represents a linear relationship.\\n\\n**Least Upper Bound Formula:**\\nFor a linear function `f(x0) = C * x0` where `C` is a positive constant, the function itself is its own least upper bound. So, the formula is `1.7165105e - 5 * x0`.\\n\\n**Why it is the upper bound:**\\nAn upper bound `g(x0)` for a function `f(x0)` satisfies `f(x0) <= g(x0)` for sufficiently large `x0`. By choosing `g(x0) = f(x0)`, the condition `f(x0) <= f(x0)` is trivially true for all `x0`. It is the *least* upper bound because any function that grows asymptotically slower than `f(x0)` or has a smaller constant factor (while still being linear) would eventually be less than `f(x0)` and thus not an upper bound.\\n\\n**Complexity of the upper bound formula:**\\nThe formula `1.7165105e - 5 * x0` is a linear function.
