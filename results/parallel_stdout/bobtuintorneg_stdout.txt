When asked for a 'formula', the function itself, `f(x0)`, is the most precise and tightest upper bound. For any `x0 >= 0`, `f(x0) <= f(x0)` is always true. So, `3.206776e - 7 * x0` is its own least upper bound formula.\\n4.  **Explain why it's the upper bound**: For any positive `x0`, the value of the function `(3.206776 * 10^-7) * x0` is exactly `(3.206776 * 10^-7) * x0`. Therefore, it serves as its own upper bound. In terms of Big-O notation, `f(x0) = C * x0` is `O(x0)`. This means there exist positive constants `M` and `x_0` such that for all `x0 > x_0`, `|C * x0| <= M * |x0|`. We can simply choose `M = C` (since `C` is positive) and `x_0 = 0`.\\n5.  **Analyze complexity**: The complexity of the formula `C * x0` is `O(x0)`, indicating a linear growth rate with respect to `x0`.\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"The given expression is `3.206776e - 7 * x0`.
