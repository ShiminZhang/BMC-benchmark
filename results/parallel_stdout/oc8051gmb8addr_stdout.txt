The expression is `f(x0) = C * x0`. This is a simple linear function.\\n2.  **Irrelevance of K:** The parameter `K` does not appear in the expression `C * x0`. Therefore, its value, whether large or small, has no bearing on the expression itself or its upper bound.\\n3.  **Type of equation:** The expression `C * x0` is of the form `a * x + b` (with `b=0`). This is a linear function. The user explicitly stated: \\\"X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!\\\". Following this instruction, the type is 'linear'.\\n4.  **Least Upper Bound Formula:** For any function `f(x)`, the function itself, `f(x)`, is its own least upper bound. This is because `f(x) <= f(x)` is always true, and no function `g(x)` can be strictly less than `f(x)` for all `x` while still serving as an upper bound. Thus, the least upper bound formula for `0.000100000000031741 * x0` is `0.000100000000031741 * x0`.\\n5.  **Explanation of Upper Bound:** The formula `0.000100000000031741 * x0` is an upper bound because for all `x0`, `0.000100000000031741 * x0 <= 0.000100000000031741 * x0` is true. It is the *least* upper bound because any function `g(x0)` that is strictly less than `0.000100000000031741 * x0` for any `x0` cannot be an upper bound for the entire function.\\n6.  **Complexity of the Upper Bound Formula:** The upper bound formula is `C * x0`. In complexity theory, the asymptotic complexity of a linear function `a * x` (where `a` is a non-zero constant) is `O(x)`. Therefore, the complexity is `O(x0)`.\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"The given expression is `f(x0) = 0.000100000000031741 * x0`. Let `C = 0.000100000000031741`.
