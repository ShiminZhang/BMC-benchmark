The condition 'when K is large' is provided, but the variable K does not appear in the given expression, making this condition irrelevant to the expression itself. The expression is of the form `C * x0`, where `C = 3.59969429986062e - 7` is a constant. This is a linear function of `x0`. In complexity theory, `x0` typically represents a non-negative input size. The 'least upper bound formula' for a function `f(x0)` is `f(x0)` itself, as `f(x0) <= f(x0)` is always true, and no tighter function exists. The formula must be an exponential or polynomial function with an integer exponent. A linear function `C * x0` is a polynomial of degree 1 (exponent 1 is an integer). The complexity of a linear function `C * x0` is `O(x0)`.\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"1.  **Expression Analysis**: The given expression is `3.59969429986062e - 7 * x0`. Let `C = 3.59969429986062e - 7`. The expression is `C * x0`.\n    2.  **Irrelevant Information**: The condition 'when K is large' is irrelevant because the variable `K` is not present in the expression `C * x0`.\n    3.  **Type of Equation**: The expression `C * x0` is a linear function. A linear function is a polynomial function of degree 1, where the exponent of `x0` is 1 (an integer).\n    4.  **Least Upper Bound Formula**: For any function `f(x0)`, the least upper bound formula is `f(x0)` itself, assuming `x0` is within its domain. This is because `f(x0) <= f(x0)` is always true, and no other function `g(x0)` can be a tighter upper bound while being strictly less than `f(x0)` for any `x0`. Therefore, the least upper bound formula for `3.59969429986062e - 7 * x0` is `3.59969429986062e - 7 * x0`. This satisfies the requirement of being a polynomial function with an integer exponent.\n    5.  **Complexity Analysis**: The asymptotic complexity of a linear function `C * x0` is `O(x0)`. The constant factor `C` is absorbed into the Big-O notation.\",\n    \"type_of_equation\": \"linear\",\n    \"llm_upper_bound\": \"3.59969429986062e - 7 * x0\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.95,\n    \"complexity\": \"O(x0)\"\n}\n```"
