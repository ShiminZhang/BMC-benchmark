The notation `**` is defined as exponentiation (e.g., `2**2` is `2^2`). Therefore, `x0 * * 0.15572321` means `x0^(0.15572321)`. Let `C1 = 0.15717554` and `C2 = 0.15572321`.

A function `g(x)` is generally considered an exponential function if it can be expressed in the form `a^(h(x))` for some base `a` and function `h(x)`. In this case, `f(x0) = e^(exp(C1 * x0^C2))`. Here, the base is `e`, and the exponent is `h(x0) = exp(C1 * x0^C2)`, which itself is an exponential function. Therefore, `f(x0)` fits the broad definition of an 'exponential function'. It is certainly not a polynomial function with an integer exponent, as its growth rate far exceeds any polynomial.\\n\\n2.  **Least Upper Bound**: In complexity theory, the 'least upper bound formula' typically refers to the tightest possible asymptotic upper bound (Big O notation). For a function that is already in a standard form representing its growth rate, the least upper bound is the function itself. Since `f(x0)` is a double exponential function, it grows faster than any single exponential function (e.g., `exp(A * x0^B)`) and any polynomial function (e.g., `x0^N`) for large `x0`.
