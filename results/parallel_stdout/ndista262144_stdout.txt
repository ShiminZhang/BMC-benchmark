This is a linear function of `x0`. The phrase 'when K is large' is a distractor, as `K` does not appear in the expression. The 'least upper bound formula' for a function `f(x)` is `f(x)` itself, as it is the tightest possible upper bound. This function `C * x0` is a polynomial function of degree 1 (since the exponent of `x0` is 1), which satisfies the requirement for the formula type. The problem explicitly states that `X^K` with `K<=1` is considered linear, reinforcing that `x0^1` is a valid form. The complexity of this linear function is `O(x0)`.\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"1.  **Identify the expression:** The expression is `2.6095066e - 7 * x0`.\n    2.  **Simplify the expression:** Let `C = 2.6095066 * 10^-7`. The expression becomes `C * x0`.\n    3.  **Analyze the variable 'K':** The variable `K` is mentioned as 'large' but does not appear in the given expression. Therefore, it is irrelevant to determining the upper bound formula for `C * x0`.\n    4.  **Determine the type of function:** `C * x0` is a linear function of `x0`. A linear function is a polynomial of degree 1.\n    5.  **Define 'least upper bound formula':** For a function `f(x)`, the least upper bound formula (in terms of function value) is `f(x)` itself, as it is the tightest possible function that bounds `f(x)` from above. Any function `g(x)` such that `g(x) < f(x)` for some `x` cannot be an upper bound for `f(x)`.\n    6.  **Apply to the given expression:** The least upper bound formula for `2.6095066e - 7 * x0` is `2.6095066e - 7 * x0`.\n    7.  **Check formula type constraint:** The problem requires the formula to be an exponential or polynomial function with an integer exponent. `2.6095066e - 7 * x0` is a polynomial function of degree 1 (the exponent of `x0` is 1, which is an integer). The clarification 'X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!' confirms that linear functions are considered in this context.\n    8.  **Explain why it is the upper bound:** The statement `2.6095066e - 7 * x0 <= 2.6095066e - 7 * x0` is always true. This formula is the tightest possible upper bound because it exactly matches the function's value at every point.\n    9.  **Analyze complexity:** The complexity of a linear function `C * x0` is `O(x0)`.\",\n    \"type_of_equation\": \"linear\",\n    \"llm_upper_bound\": \"2.6095066e - 7 * x0\",\n    \"confidence\": 1.0,\n    \"complexity\": \"O(x0)\"\n}\n```"
