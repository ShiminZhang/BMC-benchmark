For `f(x0) = C * x0`, the exact value of the function is `C * x0`. Thus, `C * x0` itself serves as the least upper bound formula. This fits the requirement of being a polynomial function with an integer exponent (exponent 1 for `x0`).\\n4.  **Analyze the complexity:** The asymptotic complexity of a linear function `C * x0` is `O(x0)`. This means that for sufficiently large `x0`, the function grows at most linearly with `x0`.\\n5.  **Clarify 'X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!':** This statement in the prompt is mathematically imprecise. A polynomial is defined as a sum of terms involving variables raised to non-negative integer powers.
