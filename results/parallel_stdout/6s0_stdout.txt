The `**` notation in the prompt description clarifies that `x0 * x0` means `x0^2`. The phrase 'when K is large' implies we are looking for the asymptotic behavior of the expression as `x0` (or some related variable) tends to infinity. Since `K` is not present in the expression, I will assume it refers to `x0` being large.\\n\\nFirst, let's simplify the expression by combining the constant terms:\\nLet `C1 = 0.026651703 * 0.904507 * 1.2212989`\\nLet `C2 = 0.73681104`\\n\\nThe expression becomes `f(x0) = C1 * x0^2 * (x0 - C2)`.\\n\\nCalculate `C1`:\\n`C1 = 0.024110000000000002 * 1.2212989` (intermediate product)\\n`C1 = 0.029448000000000003` (approximately)\\n\\nNow, expand the expression:\\n`f(x0) = C1 * x0^3 - C1 * C2 * x0^2`\\n\\nThis is a polynomial function of `x0`. The highest power of `x0` is `3`, so it's a cubic polynomial. The leading coefficient is `C1`, which is positive (`0.029448...`).\\n\\nFor a polynomial `P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + ... + a_0` with a positive leading coefficient `a_n`, the function grows without bound as `x` approaches positive infinity. The \"least upper bound formula\" in this context typically refers to the dominant term that dictates its asymptotic behavior.\\n\\nLet's propose `g(x0) = C1 * x0^3` as the upper bound formula.\\nTo verify if `g(x0)` is an upper bound for `f(x0)`, we check if `f(x0) <= g(x0)`:\\n`C1 * x0^3 - C1 * C2 * x0^2 <= C1 * x0^3`\\nSubtract `C1 * x0^3` from both sides:\\n`- C1 * C2 * x0^2 <= 0`\\n\\nSince `C1` is positive (`0.029448...`) and `C2` is positive (`0.73681104`), their product `C1 * C2` is positive. Therefore, `- C1 * C2 * x0^2` is always less than or equal to zero for any real `x0` (it's zero only if `x0=0`). This confirms that `g(x0) = C1 * x0^3` is indeed an upper bound for `f(x0)` for all `x0`.\\n\\nThis upper bound is considered \"least\" in the context of asymptotic analysis because it captures the exact growth rate. Any polynomial with a lower degree would eventually be surpassed by `f(x0)`, and any polynomial of degree 3 with a leading coefficient smaller than `C1` would also eventually be surpassed by `f(x0)` for sufficiently large `x0`.\\n\\nThe formula type is a polynomial function with an integer exponent (3).\\n\\nThe complexity of the upper bound formula `C1 * x0^3` is `O(x0^3)`.\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"The given expression is `0.026651703 * 0.904507 * x0 * x0 * (x0 - 0.73681104) * 1.2212989`. \\n\\n1.  **Simplify the expression**: We combine the constant numerical factors and interpret `x0 * x0` as `x0^2`.\\n    Let `C_coeff = 0.026651703 * 0.904507 * 1.2212989`.\\n    `C_coeff = 0.029448000000000003` (calculated value).\\n    Let `C_offset = 0.73681104`.\\n    The expression becomes `f(x0) = C_coeff * x0^2 * (x0 - C_offset)`.\\n\\n2.  **Expand the polynomial**: `f(x0) = C_coeff * x0^3 - C_coeff * C_offset * x0^2`.\\n\\n3.  **Identify the type of equation**: This is a polynomial function of `x0` with the highest degree term `x0^3`. The leading coefficient `C_coeff` is positive.\\n\\n4.  **Determine the least upper bound formula**: For a polynomial `P(x) = a_n x^n + ... + a_0` where `a_n > 0`, the function grows to positive infinity as `x` approaches positive infinity. The 'least upper bound formula' in this context, especially when considering 'K is large' (implying `x0` is large), refers to the dominant term that dictates the asymptotic growth. The dominant term is `C_coeff * x0^3`.\\n\\n5.  **Verify the upper bound**: Let `g(x0) = C_coeff * x0^3`. We need to show that `f(x0) <= g(x0)` for all (or sufficiently large) `x0`.\\n    `C_coeff * x0^3 - C_coeff * C_offset * x0^2 <= C_coeff * x0^3`\\n    Subtracting `C_coeff * x0^3` from both sides gives:\\n    `- C_coeff * C_offset * x0^2 <= 0`\\n    Since `C_coeff` (`0.029448...`) and `C_offset` (`0.73681104`) are both positive, their product `C_coeff * C_offset` is positive. Therefore, `- C_coeff * C_offset * x0^2` is always less than or equal to zero for any real `x0`. This confirms that `g(x0) = C_coeff * x0^3` is indeed an upper bound for `f(x0)` for all `x0`.\\n\\n6.  **Complexity Analysis**: The upper bound formula `0.029448000000000003 * x0^3` is a cubic polynomial. Its computational complexity is `O(x0^3)`, as it is dominated by the `x0^3` term for large `x0`.\",\n    \"type_of_equation\": \"polynomial\",\n    \"llm_upper_bound\": \"0.029448000000000003 * x0^3\",\n    \"confidence\": 1.0,\n    \"complexity\": \"O(x0^3)\"\n}\n```"
