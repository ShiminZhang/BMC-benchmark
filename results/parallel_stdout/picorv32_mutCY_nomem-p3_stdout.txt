Thus, the expression is `2.1388779 * x0 ** 0.3824715`. Let's denote `x0` as `x` for simplicity. So, the function is `f(x) = 2.1388779 * x^0.3824715`.\\n2.  **Role of K:** The phrase \\\"when K is large\\\" is present, but `K` is not a variable in the given expression. It also states \\\"X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!\\\".
