/Users/shimin/.pyenv/versions/3.12.10/lib/python3.12/site-packages/pysr/sr.py:96: UserWarning: You are using the `^` operator, but have not set up `constraints` for it. This may lead to overly complex expressions. One typical constraint is to use `constraints={..., '^': (-1, 1)}`, which will allow arbitrary-complexity base (-1) but only powers such as a constant or variable (1).
