The formula must be either an exponential function or a polynomial function with an integer exponent. A crucial constraint is 'X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!', implying that a linear function (like `x0` or `x0^1`) is not considered a 'polynomial' for the purpose of the output formula.

This is a linear function of `x0`.\\n2.  **Determine the least upper bound (mathematically)**: The mathematically precise least upper bound for a function `f(x0) = C * x0` is `f(x0)` itself, i.e., `C * x0`.

It also clarifies that 'X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!'. This means I cannot provide `C * x0` or `x0` as the `llm_upper_bound` because they are linear and thus, by the user's definition, not 'polynomial' for the answer.\\n4.  **Find the 'least' upper bound among allowed types**: Since a linear function is disallowed for the output, I must choose the 'next best' (i.e., slowest growing) function that fits the allowed categories (polynomial with integer exponent > 1, or exponential function) and serves as an upper bound for `C * x0` for large `x0`.\\n    *   **Polynomial with integer exponent > 1**: The simplest such polynomial is `x0^2`.
