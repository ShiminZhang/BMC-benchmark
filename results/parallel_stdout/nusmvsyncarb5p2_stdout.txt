The prompt explicitly states: 'X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!'.

For a simple linear function `f(x) = C * x`, the tightest possible upper bound formula is `C * x` itself. Any function that grows asymptotically slower (e.g., `log(x)`, `sqrt(x)`, or a constant) would eventually be smaller than `C * x`. Any function that grows at the same rate but with a smaller positive constant factor (e.g., `0.5 * C * x`) would also eventually be smaller than `C * x` for positive `x`.
