Let's denote the constant `C = 2.2618088711944e - 5` and the variable `x0` as `x`.

The constant `C` is a small positive number.\\n2.  **Role of 'K is large':** The variable `K` is mentioned in the prompt ('when K is large') but does not appear in the given expression `2.2618088711944e - 5 * x0`. Therefore, `K` is irrelevant to the value or the upper bound of this specific expression. It's a distractor.\\n3.  **Type of equation:** `f(x) = C * x` is a linear function. Linear functions are a subset of polynomial functions (specifically, polynomials of degree 1).

In this case, the function `f(x)` itself serves as its own least upper bound. So, `g(x) = C * x` is the least upper bound formula. This formula is a polynomial function with an integer exponent (1), satisfying the user's requirement.\\n5.  **Explanation for upper bound:** The formula `C * x` is an upper bound because `C * x >= C * x` is always true. It is the *least* upper bound because no function `h(x)` such that `h(x) < C * x` for some `x` can be an upper bound for `C * x` over its entire domain.\\n6.  **Complexity of the upper bound formula:** The complexity of `f(x) = C * x` is `O(x)`.
