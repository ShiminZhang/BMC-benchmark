I need to parse the expression, interpret the user's specific definitions, and provide the answer in the specified JSON format.\\n\\n1.  **Parse the expression**: The expression is `8.0004736e - 7 * x0 ** 0.9620511`. The `**` indicates exponentiation, so it's `(8.0004736 * 10^-7) * x0 ^ 0.9620511`. Let `C = 8.0004736 * 10^-7` and `P = 0.9620511`. The expression is `f(x0) = C * x0^P`.\\n\\n2.  **Interpret user's definitions**: \\n    *   \\\"X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!\\\": This is a crucial definition for classifying the `type_of_equation`. Since `P = 0.9620511` is less than or equal to 1, `x0^P` is considered 'linear' by the user's definition.\\n    *   \\\"the formula should either be an exponential function or a polynomial function with integer exponent.\\\": This constraint applies to the `llm_upper_bound` formula itself.\\n    *   \\\"K is large\\\": The variable K does not appear in the given expression, so this condition is irrelevant to the analysis of this specific formula.\\n\\n3.  **Determine `type_of_equation`**: Based on the user's definition, `x0^0.9620511` is considered 'linear'. Therefore, `f(x0)` is a linear type of equation.\\n\\n4.  **Determine `llm_upper_bound`**: \\n    *   The function is `f(x0) = C * x0^0.9620511`. This function is not an exponential function, nor is it a polynomial with an integer exponent (since 0.9620511 is not an integer).\\n    *   We need to find the *least* upper bound that *is* either an exponential function or a polynomial with an integer exponent.\\n    *   For `x0 >= 1`, we know that `x0^0.9620511 <= x0^1` because the exponent `0.9620511` is less than `1`. Multiplying by the positive constant `C`, we get `C * x0^0.9620511 <= C * x0^1`.\\n    *   The function `g(x0) = C * x0^1` (or simply `C * x0`) is a polynomial with an integer exponent (exponent 1).\\n    *   Is it the *least* upper bound among the allowed types? Any polynomial `x0^k` with `k < 1` would not have an integer exponent (unless `k=0`, which is a constant and not an upper bound for a growing function). Any polynomial `x0^k` with `k > 1` would be an upper bound, but `x0^1` is a tighter (least) upper bound among polynomials with integer exponents. Therefore, `C * x0` is the least upper bound that fits the criteria.\\n    *   The constant `C` is `8.0004736e-7`. So the formula is `8.0004736e-7 * x0`.\\n\\n5.  **Determine `complexity`**: The upper bound formula `8.0004736e-7 * x0` is a linear function. Its complexity is `O(x0)`.\\n\\n6.  **Confidence**: High, as all user constraints and definitions have been addressed, even the non-standard ones. The key was to distinguish between the classification of the *given equation* and the required *format of the upper bound*.\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"The given expression is `f(x0) = 8.0004736e - 7 * x0 ** 0.9620511`. Let `C = 8.0004736 * 10^-7` and `P = 0.9620511`. So, `f(x0) = C * x0^P`.\\n\\n1.  **Type of Equation**: The problem statement explicitly defines: \\\"X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!\\\". Since the exponent `P = 0.9620511` is less than or equal to 1, the term `x0^P` is classified as 'linear' according to this definition. Therefore, the entire expression `f(x0)` is considered a 'linear' type of equation.\\n\\n2.  **Least Upper Bound Formula**: The problem requires the upper bound formula to be either an \\\"exponential function\\\" or a \\\"polynomial function with integer exponent\\\".\\n    *   The function `f(x0) = C * x0^0.9620511` is not an exponential function.\\n    *   It is also not a polynomial function with an integer exponent, as `0.9620511` is not an integer.\\n    *   We need to find the *least* upper bound that *does* fit the specified format (polynomial with integer exponent in this case).\\n    *   For `x0 >= 1`, we know that `x0^0.9620511 <= x0^1` because the exponent `0.9620511` is less than `1`. Since `C` is a positive constant, multiplying by `C` preserves the inequality: `C * x0^0.9620511 <= C * x0^1`.\\n    *   The function `g(x0) = C * x0^1` (which is `C * x0`) is a polynomial with an integer exponent (the exponent is 1).\\n    *   Among all polynomials with integer exponents, `C * x0` is the tightest (least) upper bound for `C * x0^0.9620511` for sufficiently large `x0`. Any polynomial `x0^k` with `k < 1` would not have an integer exponent (unless `k=0`, which is a constant and not an upper bound for a growing function). Any polynomial `x0^k` with `k > 1` would be an upper bound, but `x0^1` is a tighter bound.\\n    *   Therefore, the least upper bound formula, adhering to the specified format, is `8.0004736e-7 * x0`.\\n\\n3.  **Complexity**: The upper bound formula `8.0004736e-7 * x0` is a linear function. Its computational complexity is `O(x0)`.\\n\\n4.  **\"K is large\"**: The variable `K` is not present in the given expression `8.0004736e - 7 * x0 * * 0.9620511`. Thus, this condition is not relevant to the analysis of this specific formula.\",\n    \"type_of_equation\": \"linear\",\n    \"llm_upper_bound\": \"8.0004736e-7 * x0\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.95,\n    \"complexity\": \"O(x0)\"\n}\n```"
