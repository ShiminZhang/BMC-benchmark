This is a linear function of `x0`.\\n\\n1.  **Analyze the equation**: `C * x0` is a simple linear function. `C` is a positive constant.\\n2.  **Least upper bound formula**: For any function `f(x)`, the least upper bound that is itself a function of `x` is `f(x)` itself. Therefore, the least upper bound for `C * x0` is `C * x0`.\\n3.  **Formula type**: The problem requires the formula to be an exponential function or a polynomial function with an integer exponent. A linear function `C * x0` is a polynomial function of degree 1 (where the exponent 1 is an integer). Thus, it satisfies this requirement.\\n4.  **\"K is large\"**: The variable `K` is not present in the given expression `C * x0`. Therefore, this phrase is considered a distractor and does not influence the form or value of the upper bound for this specific expression.\\n5.  **\"X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!\"**: This statement is a bit ambiguous. In standard mathematics and complexity theory, `x^1` (linear) is a polynomial. If the user intends to distinguish 'linear' from 'polynomial of degree > 1', it's a non-standard definition of 'polynomial'. However, the explicit requirement for the formula to be a 'polynomial function with integer exponent' is met by `x0^1`. I will adhere to the standard definition where linear functions are a subset of polynomial functions.\\n6.  **Complexity**: The complexity of a linear function `C * x0` is `O(x0)`.\\n\\nTherefore, the least upper bound formula is the expression itself.\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"The given expression is `g(x0) = 1.46000000000868e - 6 * x0`. This is a linear function of `x0`, where `C = 1.46000000000868e - 6` is a positive constant.\\n\\n1.  **Type of Equation**: A linear function is a polynomial function of degree 1. The exponent of `x0` is 1, which is an integer, satisfying the requirement for a 'polynomial function with integer exponent'.\\n2.  **Least Upper Bound**: For any function `f(x)`, the least upper bound that is itself a function of `x` is `f(x)` itself. Thus, the least upper bound formula for `g(x0)` is `g(x0)`.\\n3.  **Why it is the upper bound**: The formula `f(x0) = 1.46000000000868e - 6 * x0` is an upper bound for `g(x0)` because `g(x0) <= f(x0)` (specifically, `g(x0) = f(x0)`). It is the *least* upper bound because any function `h(x0)` that is strictly less than `f(x0)` for any `x0` would not be an upper bound.\\n4.  **'K is large'**: This phrase is irrelevant to the given expression as `K` is not a variable within `1.46000000000868e - 6 * x0`.\\n5.  **Complexity**: The complexity of a linear function `C * x0` is `O(x0)`.\",\n    \"type_of_equation\": \"linear\",\n    \"llm_upper_bound\": \"1.46000000000868e - 6 * x0\",\n    \"confidence\": 1.0,\n    \"complexity\": \"O(x0)\"\n}\n```"
