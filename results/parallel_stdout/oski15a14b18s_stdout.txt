For `f(x) = C * x`, we can choose `g(x) = x`. Since `C` is a positive constant, we can set `c = C`. Then, `|C * x| <= C * |x|` holds for all `x >= 0`. This demonstrates that `x` is an upper bound. It is the *least* upper bound in the Big-O sense because no function that grows strictly slower than `x` (e.g., `log x` or a constant) can serve as a valid Big-O upper bound for `C * x`.\\n6.  **Analyze the complexity of the upper bound formula:** The upper bound formula is `x`.
