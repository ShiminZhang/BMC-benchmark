The expression is: `- 0.008403643 * K * exp(x0 * K * ( - 0.94703716)) * x0 * K * exp(x0 * K * ( - 0.94703716))`.\\n\\nFirst, let's simplify the expression:\\nLet `C1 = -0.008403643` and `C2 = -0.94703716`.\\nThe expression becomes: `C1 * K * exp(x0 * K * C2) * x0 * K * exp(x0 * K * C2)`\\nCombine terms:\\n`= (C1 * x0) * K^2 * (exp(x0 * K * C2))^2`\\n`= (C1 * x0) * K^2 * exp(2 * x0 * K * C2)`\\n\\nLet `A = C1 * x0` and `B = 2 * C2 * x0`.\\nThe simplified expression is `f(K, x0) = A * K^2 * exp(B * K)`.\\n\\nNow, let's analyze the behavior of `f(K, x0)` as `K` becomes large, depending on the value of `x0`.\\n\\n**Constants:**\\n`C1 = -0.008403643` (negative)\\n`C2 = -0.94703716` (negative)\\n\\n**Coefficients A and B:**\\n`A = C1 * x0`\\n`B = 2 * C2 * x0`\\n\\n**Case 1: x0 > 0**\\n- `A = (negative) * (positive) = negative`\\n- `B = 2 * (negative) * (positive) = negative`\\nIn this case, `f(K, x0) = (negative constant) * K^2 * exp((negative constant) * K)`. As `K` approaches infinity, the exponential term `exp(negative_constant * K)` approaches 0 much faster than `K^2` grows. Therefore, `K^2 * exp(negative_constant * K)` approaches 0. Since `A` is negative, `f(K, x0)` approaches 0 from the negative side. The least upper bound in this scenario is 0.\\n\\n**Case 2: x0 < 0**\\n- `A = (negative) * (negative) = positive`\\n- `B = 2 * (negative) * (negative) = positive`\\nIn this case, `f(K, x0) = (positive constant) * K^2 * exp((positive constant) * K)`. As `K` approaches infinity, both `K^2` and `exp(positive_constant * K)` approach infinity. The exponential term grows much faster than the polynomial term. Therefore, `f(K, x0)` approaches infinity. The least upper bound is the function itself, as it grows without bound.\\n\\n**Case 3: x0 = 0**\\n- `A = C1 * 0 = 0`\\n- `B = 2 * C2 * 0 = 0`\\nIn this case, `f(K, 0) = 0 * K^2 * exp(0 * K) = 0`. The least upper bound is 0.\\n\\n**Conclusion for the least upper bound:**\\nIn complexity theory, when asked for an upper bound, we typically focus on the scenario where the function exhibits growth, as this determines the \"worst-case\" performance. The function grows without bound only when `x0 < 0`. Therefore, we will provide the formula for this case.\\n\\nLet's substitute the numerical values back for `x0 < 0`:\\n`A = -0.008403643 * x0`\\n`B = 2 * (-0.94703716) * x0 = -1.89407432 * x0`\\n\\nSo, the least upper bound formula is: `(-0.008403643 * x0) * K^2 * exp((-1.89407432 * x0) * K)`.\\n\\n**Type of equation:** Since `x0 < 0`, `(-1.89407432 * x0)` is a positive constant. The presence of `exp(positive_constant * K)` makes this an exponential function.\\n\\n**Complexity:** The complexity of an exponential function `C * K^p * exp(cK)` where `c > 0` is `O(exp(cK))`, as the exponential term dominates any polynomial term. More precisely, it is `O(K^2 * exp((-1.89407432 * x0) * K))`. Since `x0 < 0`, let `c = -1.89407432 * x0`, which is a positive constant. The complexity is `O(K^2 * exp(cK))`. This can also be simplified to `O(exp(cK))` because exponential growth dominates polynomial growth.\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"1.  **Simplify the Expression**: The given expression is `- 0.008403643 * K * exp(x0 * K * ( - 0.94703716)) * x0 * K * exp(x0 * K * ( - 0.94703716))`. This can be simplified by combining terms:\\n    Let `C1 = -0.008403643` and `C2 = -0.94703716`.\\n    The expression becomes `(C1 * x0) * K^2 * exp(2 * C2 * x0 * K)`.\\n\\n2.  **Analyze Behavior based on `x0`**: The behavior of the function as `K` becomes large depends critically on the sign of `x0`.\\n    *   If `x0 > 0`: The coefficient `(C1 * x0)` is negative, and the exponent `(2 * C2 * x0)` is also negative.

In Big-O notation, exponential terms dominate polynomial terms, so it can often be simplified to `O(exp(cK))`. For this specific formula, the complexity is `O(K^2 * exp((-1.89407432 * x0) * K))`. Since `x0 < 0`, let `c = -1.89407432 * x0`, which is a positive constant.
