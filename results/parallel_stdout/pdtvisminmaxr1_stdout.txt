This is because constants are dropped in Big O notation. Therefore, the asymptotic upper bound is `x0`.\\n5.  **Check constraints for the formula:** The formula `x0` (which is `x0^1`) is a polynomial function with an integer exponent (1). This satisfies the user's requirement.\\n6.  **Address 'K is large':** The variable `K` is not present in the given expression. I will assume it's a general context for the problem domain (complexity analysis often deals with large inputs) and does not directly modify the expression `C * x0`.\\n7.  **Determine the complexity of the upper bound formula:** The complexity of `x0` is `O(x0)`.\\n8.  **Construct the JSON output.**\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"The given expression is `6.272426e - 7 * x0`, which can be written as `C * x0` where `C = 6.272426 * 10^-7` is a positive constant.
