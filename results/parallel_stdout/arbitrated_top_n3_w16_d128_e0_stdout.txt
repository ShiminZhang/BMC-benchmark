This is because the function is bounded above by a constant (its maximum), and any value greater than or equal to this maximum is also an upper bound.\\n\\n3.  **Find the Global Maximum:**\\n    To find the global maximum, we take the derivative of `E(x0)` and set it to zero to find critical points.\\n    `E'(x0) = 4A x0^3 + 3B x0^2 + 2C x0`\\n    `E'(x0) = x0 * (4A x0^2 + 3B x0 + 2C)`\\n\\n    Critical points occur when `E'(x0) = 0`, which means `x0 = 0` or `4A x0^2 + 3B x0 + 2C = 0`.\\n\\n    Calculate coefficients for the quadratic equation:\\n    `4A = 4 * (-0.066378) = -0.265512`\\n    `3B = 3 * (0.007274) = 0.021822`\\n    `2C = 2 * (0.150198) = 0.300396`\\n\\n    The quadratic equation is: `-0.265512 x0^2 + 0.021822 x0 + 0.300396 = 0`\\n    Using the quadratic formula `x0 = (-b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / (2a)`:\\n    `x0 = (-0.021822 +/- sqrt(0.021822^2 - 4 * (-0.265512) * 0.300396)) / (2 * -0.265512)`\\n    `x0 = (-0.021822 +/- sqrt(0.000476200884 + 0.319000000000)) / (-0.531024)`\\n    `x0 = (-0.021822 +/- sqrt(0.319476200884)) / (-0.531024)`\\n    `x0 = (-0.021822 +/- 0.56522225) / (-0.531024)`\\n\\n    Two roots for the quadratic part:\\n    `x0_1 = (-0.021822 + 0.56522225) / (-0.531024) = 0.54340025 / -0.531024 = -1.02329` (approx)\\n    `x0_2 = (-0.021822 - 0.56522225) / (-0.531024) = -0.58704425 / -0.531024 = 1.10549` (approx)\\n\\n    The critical points are `x0 = 0`, `x0 = -1.02329`, and `x0 = 1.10549`.\\n\\n    Evaluate `E(x0)` at these points:\\n    `E(0) = 0`\\n    `E(-1.02329) = -0.066378 * (-1.02329)^4 + 0.007274 * (-1.02329)^3 + 0.150198 * (-1.02329)^2`\\n    `= -0.066378 * 1.09758 + 0.007274 * (-1.07055) + 0.150198 * 1.04712`\\n    `= -0.072848 - 0.007788 + 0.157298 = 0.076662` (approx)\\n\\n    `E(1.10549) = -0.066378 * (1.10549)^4 + 0.007274 * (1.10549)^3 + 0.150198 * (1.10549)^2`\\n    `= -0.066378 * 1.49685 + 0.007274 * 1.35255 + 0.150198 * 1.22209`\\n    `= -0.099386 + 0.009848 + 0.183535 = 0.093997` (approx)\\n\\n    Comparing the values, the global maximum is approximately `0.093997`.\\n\\n4.  **Address User's Definitions and Format:**\\n    The least upper bound is a constant value: `0.093997`.\\n    The user states: \"the formula should either be an exponential function or a polynomial function with integer exponent. X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!\"\\n    This implies a non-standard definition where:\\n    *   `K=0` (constant function) is considered \"linear\".\\n    *   `K=1` (linear function) is considered \"linear\".\\n    *   `K>1` (polynomial function) is considered \"polynomial\".\\n\\n    Since the least upper bound is a constant (degree 0 polynomial), according to the user's definition, it falls under the \"linear\" category for `type_of_equation`.\\n    The complexity of a constant function is `O(1)`.\\n\\n    The variable `K` in \"when K is large\" is not part of the expression but indicates an asymptotic analysis. For a function that tends to negative infinity, the least upper bound is its global maximum, which is a constant.\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"The given expression simplifies to a polynomial function: `E(x0) = -0.066378 x0^4 + 0.007274 x0^3 + 0.150198 x0^2`. The leading coefficient of this polynomial is negative (`-0.066378`). Therefore, as `x0` approaches positive or negative infinity, the function `E(x0)` approaches negative infinity. In such cases, the least upper bound of the function is its global maximum value.\\n\\nTo find the global maximum, we compute the derivative of `E(x0)` and find its roots (critical points). The derivative is `E'(x0) = x0 * (-0.265512 x0^2 + 0.021822 x0 + 0.300396)`. The critical points are `x0 = 0`, `x0 \u2248 -1.02329`, and `x0 \u2248 1.10549`. Evaluating `E(x0)` at these points:\\n*   `E(0) = 0`\\n*   `E(-1.02329) \u2248 0.076662`\\n*   `E(1.10549) \u2248 0.093997`\\n\\nThe largest of these values is approximately `0.093997`. Since the function tends to negative infinity for large `|x0|`, this value represents the global maximum and thus the least upper bound.\\n\\nThe user's specific instruction states: \\\"X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!\\\". This implies that a constant function (which is `X^0`, where `K=0`) should be classified as 'linear'. Therefore, the `type_of_equation` is 'linear'. The complexity of a constant value is `O(1)`.\",\n    \"type_of_equation\": \"linear\",\n    \"llm_upper_bound\": \"0.093997\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.95,\n    \"complexity\": \"O(1)\"\n}\n```"
