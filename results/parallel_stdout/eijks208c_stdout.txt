The `* *` notation, as clarified by the problem statement (`** means power 2**2 is 2^2`), indicates exponentiation. Therefore, the expression should be interpreted as `1.2485617e - 7 * x0 ** 1.7217263`. Let `C1 = 1.2485617e - 7` (which is `1.2485617 * 10^-7`) and `C2 = 1.7217263`. The expression is `f(x0) = C1 * x0^C2`. The phrase 'when K is large' implies we are considering the asymptotic behavior as the input variable grows.

As `x` approaches infinity, the function itself represents its least upper bound. Thus, the least upper bound formula is the expression itself: `1.2485617e - 7 * x0**1.7217263`.\\n\\n2.  **Type of Equation**: The problem provides specific rules for classification: 'X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!'.

It is a power function, but that's not an option.\\n\\n3.  **Complexity**: The complexity of a power function `C * x^a` is `O(x^a)`.
