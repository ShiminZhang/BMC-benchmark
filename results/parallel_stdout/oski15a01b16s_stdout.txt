Therefore, the expression can be written as `C * x0^(a)`, where `C = 1.4087968 * 10^-7` and `a = 1.0495164`. The phrase 'when K is large' is interpreted as referring to the variable `x0` being large, as `K` is not present in the expression itself. We need to find the least upper bound formula that is either an exponential function or a polynomial function with an integer exponent.\\n\\n1.  **Analyze the original function**: `f(x0) = (1.4087968 * 10^-7) * x0^(1.0495164)`. This is a power function.\\n2.  **Classify the original function type**: According to the prompt's rules: 'X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!'. Our exponent `a = 1.0495164` is `> 1`. However, it is not an integer. A polynomial function is defined as having integer exponents. An exponential function has the variable in the exponent (e.g., `b^x0`). Since `f(x0)` does not fit the definition of linear, polynomial (due to non-integer exponent), or exponential, its type is 'unknown' among the given categories.\\n3.  **Determine the least upper bound formula**: We need an upper bound `g(x0)` such that `f(x0) <= g(x0)` for large `x0`, and `g(x0)` must be either an exponential function or a polynomial function with an integer exponent.\\n    *   Exponential functions grow much faster than power functions. Therefore, if a polynomial upper bound exists, it will be 'least' in terms of growth rate compared to an exponential one.\\n    *   We are looking for a polynomial `A * x0^k` where `k` is an integer. For `x0` large, `x0^a <= x0^k` if and only if `a <= k`.\n    *   Given `a = 1.0495164`, the smallest integer `k` that satisfies `k >= a` is `k = ceil(1.0495164) = 2`.\n    *   Thus, `x0^2` is the smallest integer-exponent power function that serves as an upper bound for `x0^(1.0495164)`.\n    *   We can use the original constant `C` for the upper bound. So, `(1.4087968 * 10^-7) * x0^(1.0495164) <= (1.4087968 * 10^-7) * x0^2` for `x0 >= 1`.\\n    *   The least upper bound formula, conforming to the specified types, is `1.4087968e-7 * x0^2`.\\n4.  **Determine the complexity of the upper bound**: The complexity of `1.4087968e-7 * x0^2` is `O(x0^2)`.\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"The given expression is `f(x0) = 1.4087968e-7 * x0^(1.0495164)`. The exponent `1.0495164` is greater than 1 but is not an integer. According to the problem's definitions, this function is not linear (exponent > 1), not polynomial (exponent is not an integer), and not exponential (variable `x0` is the base, not the exponent). Thus, its type is 'unknown' among the provided categories.\\n\\nTo find the least upper bound formula that is either an exponential function or a polynomial function with an integer exponent:\\n1.  An exponential function grows significantly faster than a power function. Therefore, a polynomial upper bound will be 'tighter' (least in terms of growth rate) if available.\\n2.  We need to find the smallest integer `k` such that `x0^k` eventually dominates `x0^(1.0495164)` for large `x0`. This occurs when `k >= 1.0495164`. The smallest integer `k` satisfying this condition is `k = 2` (i.e., `ceil(1.0495164)`).\\n3.  Therefore, `x0^2` is the lowest-degree integer-exponent polynomial that serves as an upper bound for `x0^(1.0495164)`. We retain the original constant `1.4087968e-7`.\\n4.  The least upper bound formula, conforming to the specified types, is `1.4087968e-7 * x0^2`.\\n5.  The complexity of this upper bound is `O(x0^2)`.\",\n    \"type_of_equation\": \"unknown\",\n    \"llm_upper_bound\": \"1.4087968e-7 * x0^2\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.95,\n    \"complexity\": \"O(x0^2)\"\n}\n```"
