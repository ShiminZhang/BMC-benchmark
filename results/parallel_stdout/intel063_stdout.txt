The formula must be an exponential function or a polynomial function with an integer exponent. The prompt clarifies that `**` means power (e.g., `2**2` is `2^2`), which implies `* *` in the given expression is a typo for `**`.\\n\\n1.  **Interpret the expression**: Let `C1 = 8.2660434e - 14` and `C2 = 2.1947215`. Based on the `**` clarification, the expression is interpreted as `C1 * x0 ** C2`, which is `C1 * x0^(C2)`. So, `f(x0) = (8.2660434 * 10^-14) * x0^(2.1947215)`.\\n\\n2.  **Analyze the function type**: This is a power function. The exponent `2.1947215` is a real number, not an integer. Therefore, the function itself is not a polynomial with an integer exponent, nor is it an exponential function (which would be of the form `a^x0`).\\n\\n3.  **Address the constraint for the upper bound formula**: The upper bound formula must be either an exponential function or a polynomial function with an integer exponent. Since the original function is a power function with a non-integer exponent, we need to find a suitable polynomial with an integer exponent that bounds it from above.\\n\\n4.  **Determine the least integer exponent for an upper bound**: For `x0 > 1`, if we have `x0^p` and we want to find an integer `k` such that `x0^p <= x0^k`, then `k` must be greater than or equal to `p`. The smallest integer `k` that satisfies `k >= 2.1947215` is `ceil(2.1947215) = 3`. Therefore, for `x0 >= 1`, `x0^(2.1947215) <= x0^3`.\\n\\n5.  **Construct the upper bound formula**: Multiplying by the constant `C1`, the least upper bound formula that fits the specified format is `C1 * x0^3`. This is `8.2660434e - 14 * x0^3`.\\n\\n6.  **Address \"when K is large\"**: The variable `K` is not present in the given expression. This phrase is irrelevant to the calculation of the upper bound for the provided formula. In complexity theory, \"large\" usually refers to the input variable (here, `x0`) approaching infinity, which supports the choice of `x0^3` as an upper bound for `x0^(2.1947215)`.\\n\\n7.  **Determine the type of the upper bound equation**: The formula `8.2660434e - 14 * x0^3` is a polynomial function with an integer exponent (3). The prompt states `X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!`, implying `X^K` with `K > 1` is considered polynomial.\\n\\n8.  **Determine the complexity**: The complexity of a polynomial function `C * x^k` is `O(x^k)`. Thus, the complexity of `8.2660434e - 14 * x0^3` is `O(x0^3)`.\",\n    \"reasoning\": \"The given expression is `8.2660434e - 14 * x0 * * 2.1947215`. Based on the prompt's clarification that `**` means power, we interpret `* *` as `**`. Thus, the expression is `(8.2660434 * 10^-14) * x0^(2.1947215)`.\\n\\nThis is a power function with a non-integer exponent (2.1947215). The problem requires the upper bound formula to be either an exponential function or a polynomial function with an integer exponent. Since `2.1947215` is not an integer, we need to find the smallest integer exponent `k` such that `x0^k` bounds `x0^(2.1947215)` from above for large `x0` (i.e., `x0 >= 1`).\\n\\nFor `x0 >= 1`, `x0^p <= x0^k` if and only if `p <= k`. The smallest integer `k` greater than or equal to `2.1947215` is `ceil(2.1947215) = 3`. Therefore, `x0^3` serves as the least polynomial upper bound with an integer exponent.\\n\\nThe constant `8.2660434e - 14` is a positive constant, so the upper bound formula is `8.2660434e - 14 * x0^3`.\\n\\nThe phrase 'when K is large' is irrelevant as the variable K is not present in the given expression.\\n\\nThe complexity of this polynomial upper bound is determined by its highest degree term, which is `x0^3`.\",\n    \"type_of_equation\": \"polynomial\",\n    \"llm_upper_bound\": \"8.2660434e - 14 * x0^3\",\n    \"confidence\": 0.95,\n    \"complexity\": \"O(x0^3)\"\n}\n```"
