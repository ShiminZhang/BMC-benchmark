    "reasoning": "1.  **Interpretation of Notation:** The notation `* *` is explicitly defined as exponentiation. Thus, `x0 * * 1.5198421` means `x0^1.5198421`, and `( ... ) * * 0.99785006` means `( ... )^0.99785006`.\\n2.  **Asymptotic Analysis for Large `x0`:** Let the given expression be `f(x0)`.\\n    `f(x0) = (8.533967e - 11 * x0^1.5198421 + 5.7807371 - 6.521826664715 * exp( - 8.533967e - 11 * x0^1.4124684)) ^ 0.99785006`\\n    As `x0` approaches infinity:\\n    *   The term `8.533967e - 11 * x0^1.5198421` is a polynomial term with an exponent greater than 1, so it grows unboundedly.\\n    *   The constant term `5.7807371` becomes negligible.\\n    *   The exponential term `- 6.521826664715 * exp( - 8.533967e - 11 * x0^1.4124684)` approaches `0` because `exp(-positive_large_number)` approaches `0`. This term also becomes negligible.\\n    Therefore, for large `x0`, the expression inside the parenthesis is dominated by `8.533967e - 11 * x0^1.5198421`.\\n    So, `f(x0)` is asymptotically equivalent to `(8.533967e - 11 * x0^1.5198421)^0.99785006`.\\n3.  **Simplification of Asymptotic Behavior:**\\n    `f(x0) ~ (8.533967e - 11)^0.99785006 * (x0^1.5198421)^0.99785006`\\n    `f(x0) ~ (8.533967e - 11)^0.99785006 * x0^(1.5198421 * 0.99785006)`\\n    Calculating the exponent: `1.5198421 * 0.99785006 = 1.5165489906626`.\\n    Calculating the constant: `(8.533967e - 11)^0.99785006 approx 8.969e-11`.\\n    Thus, the asymptotic behavior is `(8.969e-11) * x0^1.51654899`.\\n4.  **Applying Constraints for Least Upper Bound:** The problem requires the upper bound formula to be either an exponential function or a polynomial function with an *integer exponent*. Our derived asymptotic behavior has a non-integer exponent (`1.51654899`). To satisfy the constraint, we must choose the smallest integer exponent `m` such that `x0^1.51654899 = O(x0^m)`.\\n    Since `1.51654899` is between `1` and `2`, the smallest integer exponent `m` that bounds it from above for large `x0` is `m = 2` (i.e., `ceil(1.51654899)`).\\n5.  **Formulating the Upper Bound:** The least upper bound formula, adhering to the integer exponent constraint, will be of the form `C * x0^2`. For `x0 >= 1`, `x0^1.51654899 < x0^2`. Therefore, we can use the calculated constant `8.969e-11` as `C` to provide a specific formula.\\n6.  **Type and Complexity:** The resulting formula `(8.969e-11) * x0^2` is a polynomial function with an integer exponent (2). Its complexity is `O(x0^2)`.",
