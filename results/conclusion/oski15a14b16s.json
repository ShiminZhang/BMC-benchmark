  "reasoning": "The expression `1.42122142565194e - 6 * x0` is a linear function of `x0`. The least upper bound formula for any function `f(x0)` is `f(x0)` itself, as it provides the tightest possible bound. Therefore, `1.42122142565194e - 6 * x0` is its own least upper bound. This formula, `C * x0`, is of the form `C * x0^1`, which is a polynomial with an integer exponent (1), thus satisfying the requirement for the formula type ('polynomial function with integer exponent'). According to the user's specific rule 'X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!', the equation type is classified as 'linear'. The variable `K` is not present in the given expression and therefore does not influence its upper bound or complexity. The complexity of a linear function `C * x0` is `O(x0)`.",
