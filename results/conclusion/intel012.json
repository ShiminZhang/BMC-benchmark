  "reasoning": "The given 'equation' is a constant value: `C = 11.2343600000000`. In the context of complexity theory, when analyzing a function `f(K)`, the least upper bound is the tightest function `g(K)` such that `f(K) <= g(K)` for all sufficiently large `K`. For a constant function `f(K) = C`, the least upper bound is `C` itself, as `C <= C` is always true, and no smaller value or function can consistently bound `C` from above. The problem requires the formula to be either an exponential function or a polynomial function with an integer exponent. A constant `C` can be expressed as a polynomial function of `K` with an integer exponent of 0: `C * K^0`. For example, `11.23436 * K^0 = 11.23436`. This satisfies the requirement. The phrase 'when K is large' does not change the value of the constant, nor does it introduce `K` into the constant itself. The complexity of evaluating or representing a constant value is `O(1)`, meaning it takes constant time regardless of the input size `K` (which is not even used here).",
