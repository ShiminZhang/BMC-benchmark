    "reasoning": "1.  **Expression Interpretation**: The given expression `5.79281957877077e - 16 * x0 * * 2` is interpreted as `C * x0^2`, where `C = 5.79281957877077e - 16` is a positive constant. The `* * 2` notation is understood as exponentiation (`^2`) as per the prompt's clarification.\n2.  **Irrelevance of K**: The variable `K` is mentioned as 'large' but does not appear in the expression itself. Therefore, `K` does not influence the functional form or the upper bound of this specific expression with respect to `x0`.\n3.  **Type of Equation**: The expression `C * x0^2` is a polynomial function of degree 2. The exponent of `x0` is 2, which is a positive integer greater than 1, fitting the definition of a polynomial as per the prompt's guidance (\"X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!\").\n4.  **Least Upper Bound Formula**: For a function `f(x0) = C * x0^2` where `C` is a positive constant, the function itself serves as its own tightest (least) upper bound. This means `f(x0) <= f(x0)` is always true. Any function that grows asymptotically slower than `x0^2` would not be an upper bound, and any function that grows asymptotically faster would be an upper bound but not the *least* one. Thus, the formula for the least upper bound is `5.79281957877077e - 16 * x0^2`.\n5.  **Complexity Analysis**: The complexity of a polynomial function `a * x^n` is `O(x^n)`. For `C * x0^2`, the dominant term is `x0^2`, so its asymptotic complexity is `O(x0^2)`.",
