  "reasoning": "The given expression is `1.1243975e - 11 * x0 * * 2`. Interpreting `* * 2` as exponentiation, the expression becomes `1.1243975e-11 * x0^2`. Let `C = 1.1243975e-11`. The expression is `C * x0^2`.\n\nThis is a polynomial function of `x0` with an integer exponent of 2. The mention of 'K is large' is irrelevant as K is not present in the expression; we analyze the behavior with respect to `x0`.\n\nFor a positive constant `C`, the function `f(x0) = C * x0^2` is a quadratic polynomial. The 'least upper bound formula' for a function `f(x)` is typically `f(x)` itself when considering its functional form and growth rate. Any function `g(x0)` that serves as an upper bound must satisfy `C * x0^2 <= g(x0)` for all relevant `x0`. To be the *least* upper bound in terms of functional form, `g(x0)` should grow no faster than `C * x0^2`. The tightest such formula is `C * x0^2` itself.\n\n**Why it is the upper bound**: The formula `1.1243975e-11 * x0^2` is an upper bound for the expression `1.1243975e-11 * x0^2` because `1.1243975e-11 * x0^2 <= 1.1243975e-11 * x0^2` is always true. It is the *least* upper bound because no function that grows asymptotically slower than `x0^2` can bound `C * x0^2` from above for large `x0`, and no function `D * x0^2` with `D < C` can bound `C * x0^2` for all `x0 > 0`.\n\n**Complexity**: The complexity of the function `1.1243975e-11 * x0^2` is determined by its highest power term, which is `x0^2`. Therefore, its complexity is `O(x0^2)`.",
