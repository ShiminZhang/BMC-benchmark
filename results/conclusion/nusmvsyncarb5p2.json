  "reasoning": "The given expression is `3.922916e - 7 * x0`. Let `C = 3.922916 * 10^-7`. The expression is `C * x0`. This is a linear function of `x0`. Following the user's specific instruction that 'X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!', this equation is classified as 'linear'.\n\nFor a function `f(x) = C * x`, the 'least upper bound formula' refers to the tightest function `g(x)` such that `f(x) <= g(x)` for sufficiently large `x`. The function `C * x` itself serves as its own least upper bound. Any function that grows asymptotically slower than `C * x` (e.g., `log(x)`, `sqrt(x)`, or a constant) would eventually be smaller than `C * x`. Any function that grows at the same rate but with a smaller positive constant factor (e.g., `0.5 * C * x`) would also eventually be smaller than `C * x` for positive `x`. Therefore, `3.922916e - 7 * x` is the least upper bound formula.\n\nThe complexity of this linear function `C * x` is `O(x)`, as its growth rate is directly proportional to `x`.",
