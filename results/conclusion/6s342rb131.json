    "reasoning": "The given expression is `f(x0) = 4.00000000011502e - 7 * x0`. Let `C = 4.00000000011502e - 7`. The function is `f(x0) = C * x0`.\n\n1.  **Type of Equation:** This is a linear function. Following the specific instruction \"X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!\", the equation is classified as 'linear' because the highest exponent of `x0` is 1.\n\n2.  **Least Upper Bound Formula:** The 'least upper bound formula' refers to the tightest function `g(x0)` such that `f(x0) <= g(x0)` for all `x0` (especially for large `x0`, as implied by the context of complexity analysis). For `f(x0) = C * x0`, the function itself, `C * x0`, serves as the tightest possible upper bound. Any function `g(x0)` that is strictly less than `C * x0` for `x0 > 0` cannot be an upper bound. Therefore, the least upper bound formula is `4.00000000011502e - 7 * x0`.\n\n3.  **Complexity Analysis:** The upper bound formula is `4.00000000011502e - 7 * x0`. In Big-O notation, constant factors are disregarded. Thus, the complexity of this formula is `O(x0)`, which signifies linear complexity.",
