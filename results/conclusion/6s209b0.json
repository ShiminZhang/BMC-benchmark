    "reasoning": "The given expression `f(x0) = 3.0993095e - 7 * x0` is a linear function. Let `C = 3.0993095 * 10^-7`. So, `f(x0) = C * x0`. A function `g(x0)` is an upper bound for `f(x0)` if `f(x0) <= g(x0)` for all sufficiently large `x0`. The least upper bound is the tightest such bound. For a linear function `C * x0`, the function itself, `C * x0`, serves as its own least upper bound because `C * x0 <= C * x0` is always true. No function that grows strictly slower than `C * x0` (e.g., `C * x0 - epsilon * x0` for any `epsilon > 0`) can be an upper bound for `C * x0` for all sufficiently large `x0`. This formula `C * x0` is a polynomial function of degree 1 (with an integer exponent of 1 for `x0`), satisfying the requirement for the type of function. The mention of 'K is large' is irrelevant as `K` is not a variable in the given expression.",
