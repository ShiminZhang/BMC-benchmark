  "reasoning": "The given expression is `f(x0) = 2.8707842e - 7 * x0`. This is a linear function of `x0`. Let `C = 2.8707842e - 7`. The least upper bound in an asymptotic sense for `C * x0` is `O(x0)`. The function `x0` itself would be the tightest representative. However, the problem explicitly states that 'X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!' for the output formula. This means `x0` (which is `x0^1`) is not considered a 'polynomial function with integer exponent' in the context of this question's output requirements. We are therefore constrained to choose an upper bound that is either an exponential function or a polynomial function with an integer exponent `K > 1`. Among these allowed types, we seek the 'least' (tightest) upper bound. \n\n1.  **Exponential functions:** Examples include `2^x0`, `e^x0`. These grow very rapidly.\n2.  **Polynomial functions with integer exponent K > 1:** Examples include `x0^2`, `x0^3`, etc.\n\nFor sufficiently large `x0`, any polynomial function `x0^K` (with `K > 0`) grows asymptotically slower than any exponential function `a^x0` (with `a > 1`). Therefore, a polynomial function will be a tighter upper bound than an exponential function for large `x0`. Among the allowed polynomial functions (`x0^K` with `K > 1`), `x0^2` is the asymptotically smallest (tightest) choice. \n\nTo demonstrate `x0^2` is an upper bound for `C * x0`: For `x0` large enough, `C * x0 <= x0^2`. This inequality holds true when `x0^2 - C * x0 >= 0`, which simplifies to `x0 * (x0 - C) >= 0`. Since `C` is a positive constant (`2.8707842e - 7`), and `x0` is assumed to be large (positive), this inequality holds when `x0 - C >= 0`, or `x0 >= C`. Thus, `x0^2` is a valid upper bound for `C * x0` for sufficiently large `x0` and is the tightest among the allowed types.",
