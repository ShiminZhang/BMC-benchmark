    "reasoning": "The given expression is `f(x) = 3.73369393198404e - 18 * x^(2.5575368)`. The problem asks for the least upper bound formula, with the constraint that the formula must be either an exponential function or a polynomial function with an integer exponent. The original function has a non-integer exponent, so it does not fit these criteria directly.\n\nTo find the least upper bound that satisfies the 'polynomial with integer exponent' constraint, we identify the smallest integer exponent `k` that is greater than or equal to the original exponent `2.5575368`. This integer is `k = 3`. The user's definition of 'polynomial' requires an integer exponent greater than 1, which `3` satisfies.\n\nTherefore, for large `x` (specifically `x >= 1`), `x^(2.5575368)` is bounded above by `x^3`. Since the constant `3.73369393198404e - 18` is positive, the least upper bound formula that fits the specified format is `3.73369393198404e - 18 * x^3`.\n\nThe complexity of this upper bound formula is `O(x^3)`.",
