    "reasoning": "The given expression is `3.2255417e - 7 * x0`. Let `C = 3.2255417 * 10^-7`. The expression can be written as `f(x0) = C * x0`. This is a linear function of `x0`.\n\n**Why it is the upper bound:**\nFor a function `f(x0)` where `C` is a positive constant, the least upper bound formula is `f(x0)` itself. This is because for any `x0 >= 0`, `f(x0) <= f(x0)`. No function `g(x0)` that is asymptotically smaller than `f(x0)` can serve as an upper bound, and while functions asymptotically larger than `f(x0)` are upper bounds, `f(x0)` is the *least* (tightest) such formula. The phrase 'when K is large' indicates that we are considering the asymptotic behavior of `f(x0)` as `x0` (the input variable) tends to infinity, which is standard in complexity analysis.\n\n**Type of Equation:**\nAccording to your specific instruction, 'X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!', the function `C * x0` (which has `x0` raised to the power of 1) is classified as a 'linear' function.\n\n**Complexity of the upper bound formula:**\nThe formula `3.2255417e - 7 * x0` is a linear function. Its time complexity is directly proportional to `x0`. Therefore, its complexity is `O(x0)`.",
