  "reasoning": "The given function is `f(x0) = exp(exp(0.15717554 * x0^(0.15572321)))`. This is a double exponential function. While 'double exponential' is a more specific classification, it falls under the broader category of 'exponential functions' because it can be written as `e^(h(x0))` where `h(x0) = exp(0.15717554 * x0^(0.15572321))`. This interpretation allows the answer to conform to the specified output format, which requires the formula to be either an exponential or a polynomial function.\n\nFor functions that already represent a distinct growth class, the least upper bound in asymptotic notation (Big O) is the function itself. This function grows faster than any single exponential or polynomial function. Therefore, the tightest upper bound is the function itself. The condition 'when K is large' refers to the asymptotic behavior as the variable `x0` tends to infinity.",
