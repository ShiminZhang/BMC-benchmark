  "reasoning": "The given expression is `f(x0) = 4.59605694373151e - 17 * x0^3`. Let `C = 4.59605694373151e - 17`. Since `C` is a positive constant, the function is `f(x0) = C * x0^3`. \\n\\n1.  **Type of Equation:** This is a polynomial function of degree 3, as the highest power of the variable `x0` is 3, which is a positive integer. \\n\\n2.  **Least Upper Bound Formula:** In complexity theory, the",
