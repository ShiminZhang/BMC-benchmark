  "reasoning": "The given expression is `1.5140675e - 11 * x0 * * 1.9814947`. \n\n1.  **Interpretation of the Expression:** We interpret `1.5140675e - 11` as the constant `C = 1.5140675 * 10^-11`. The `* *` operator is explicitly defined by the user as the power operator (e.g., `2**2` means `2^2`). Thus, the expression can be written as `C * x0^1.9814947`, where `x0` is the independent variable.\n\n2.  **Addressing 'K is large':** The variable `K` is not present in the provided expression. Therefore, the behavior of the expression itself is independent of `K`. We will find the least upper bound for the given expression with respect to its variable `x0`.\n\n3.  **Type of the Original Equation:** The original function is `f(x0) = (1.5140675 * 10^-11) * x0^1.9814947`. According to the user's specific definitions:\n    *   A function `X^K` is considered linear if `K <= 1`.\n    *   A function is considered polynomial if it has an integer exponent greater than 1.\n    *   An exponential function is of the form `A * B^x`.\n    Since the exponent `1.9814947` is not an integer, `f(x0)` is not a polynomial by this definition. Since `1.9814947 > 1`, it is not linear. It is also not an exponential function. Therefore, its type, based on the provided categories, is `unknown`.\n\n4.  **Finding the Least Upper Bound:** We need to find a function `g(x0)` that serves as the least upper bound for `f(x0)` for large `x0`, and `g(x0)` must be either an exponential function or a polynomial function with an integer exponent.\n    *   **Polynomial Candidate:** The exponent of `x0` in `f(x0)` is `1.9814947`. To find a polynomial upper bound `A * x0^N` (where `N` is an integer), we must choose an integer `N` such that `N >= 1.9814947`. The smallest such integer is `N = 2`. For `x0 > 1`, we have `x0^1.9814947 < x0^2`. Therefore, `(1.5140675 * 10^-11) * x0^1.9814947 < (1.5140675 * 10^-11) * x0^2`. This function, `(1.5140675 * 10^-11) * x0**2`, is a polynomial with an integer exponent (2), fitting the user's criteria.\n    *   **Exponential Candidate:** Any exponential function `A * B^x0` (with `B > 1`) grows asymptotically much faster than any polynomial function `A * x0^N`. Thus, `(1.5140675 * 10^-11) * x0**2` is a significantly tighter (and therefore the 'least') upper bound compared to any exponential function.\n\n5.  **Conclusion:** The least upper bound formula, adhering to the specified types, is `(1.5140675e - 11) * x0**2`.\n\n6.  **Complexity of the Upper Bound:** The complexity of a polynomial function `A * x0^N` is `O(x0^N)`. For the upper bound `(1.5140675e - 11) * x0**2`, the complexity is `O(x0^2)`.",
