    "reasoning": "1.  **Interpretation of the Expression**: The notation `x0 * * 0.28765112` is interpreted as `x0^(0.28765112)` based on the provided clarification `** means power 2**2 is 2^2`. Therefore, the given function is `f(x0) = exp(0.08791455 * x0^(0.28765112))`.\n    2.  **Irrelevance of K**: The variable `K` is not present in the expression. Thus, the condition \\",
