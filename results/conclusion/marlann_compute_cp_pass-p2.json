  "reasoning": "The given expression is `f(x0) = 4.086181e - 7 * x0`. Let `C = 4.086181e - 7`. The expression is `C * x0`.\n\n1.  **Least Upper Bound Formula**: For any real number `x0`, the value of the function `f(x0)` is `C * x0`. The least upper bound of `f(x0)` is `f(x0)` itself, because `f(x0) <= f(x0)` holds true, and no function `g(x0)` such that `g(x0) < f(x0)` for all `x0` can serve as an upper bound for `f(x0)`. Therefore, the least upper bound formula is `4.086181e - 7 * x0`.\n\n2.  **Type of Function**: The formula `4.086181e - 7 * x0` is a linear function. Linear functions are a specific type of polynomial function (degree 1), as the exponent of `x0` is 1 (an integer). The prompt provides 'linear' as a specific option for `type_of_equation`, which is the most precise classification here.\n\n3.  **Irrelevance of K**: The variable `K` is not present in the expression `4.086181e - 7 * x0`. Therefore, the condition 'when K is large' has no impact on the analysis of this specific expression.\n\n4.  **Complexity**: The asymptotic complexity of a linear function `C * x0` is `O(x0)`, indicating that its growth rate is proportional to `x0`.",
