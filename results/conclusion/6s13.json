  "reasoning": "The given expression is `f(x0) = 0.02400895 * exp(x0)`. This is an exponential function of `x0`. The variable `K` is not present in the expression, making the condition 'when K is large' irrelevant to determining the upper bound of this specific formula. For a function `f(x0)` that is itself an exponential function and is unbounded (as `exp(x0)` is for increasing `x0`), the least upper bound formula is the function itself. This is because any function `g(x0)` that is strictly less than `f(x0)` for any `x0` cannot be an upper bound. Conversely, any function `g(x0)` that is an upper bound must satisfy `g(x0) >= f(x0)` for all `x0`. The 'least' such function is `f(x0)` itself. The formula `0.02400895 * exp(x0)` is an exponential function, which satisfies the requirement for the type of the upper bound formula. The complexity of an exponential function `C * exp(x0)` is characterized by its exponential growth rate, denoted as `O(exp(x0))` in Big O notation.",
