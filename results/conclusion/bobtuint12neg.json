    "reasoning": "The given expression is `1.5473603e - 5 * x0`. Let `C` represent the constant `1.5473603 * 10^-5`. The expression can be written as `C * x0`.\n\n1.  **Type of Equation**: This is a linear function of `x0`. A linear function is a specific type of polynomial function (degree 1), which satisfies the requirement for the formula to be a polynomial with an integer exponent.\n\n2.  **Least Upper Bound**: For any function `f(x)`, the tightest possible upper bound function is `f(x)` itself, provided `f(x)` is well-defined. In this case, `C * x0` is the least upper bound formula because `C * x0 <= C * x0` is always true, and no function `g(x0)` that is strictly less than `C * x0` for any `x0` can serve as an upper bound for `C * x0`.\n\n3.  **Irrelevance of K**: The phrase 'when K is large' is mentioned, but the variable `K` does not appear in the expression `1.5473603e - 5 * x0`. Therefore, `K` is not directly relevant to the form or value of the expression itself. We treat `x0` as the independent variable.\n\n4.  **Complexity**: The complexity of the upper bound formula `C * x0` is `O(x0)`, indicating linear growth with respect to `x0`.",
