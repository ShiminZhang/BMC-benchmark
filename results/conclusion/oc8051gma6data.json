  "reasoning": "The given expression is `f(x) = 6.00000000190448e - 5 * x`. Let `C = 6.00000000190448e - 5`. Thus, `f(x) = C * x`. This is a linear function. In complexity theory, when we seek an upper bound for a function, we are typically interested in its asymptotic behavior as the input (`x` in this case) grows large. The phrase 'when K is large' is interpreted in this context, implying we consider `x` to be large. The least upper bound for a function `f(x)` is `f(x)` itself, as `f(x) <= f(x)` is trivially true for all `x`. It is the *least* upper bound because no function that grows strictly slower than `f(x)` (e.g., `(C - epsilon) * x` for any `epsilon > 0`) can serve as an upper bound for all sufficiently large `x`. The function `C * x` is a polynomial function with an integer exponent (1), satisfying the specified type requirement. The complexity of this linear function is `O(x)`.",
