  "reasoning": "The expression `2.3390528e - 5 * x0` is a linear function of `x0`. Let `C = 2.3390528 * 10^-5`. The function is `f(x0) = C * x0`. Since `C` is a positive constant, as `x0` (the variable implicitly considered large, as `K` is large) increases, the function `f(x0)` increases linearly. The least upper bound formula for a linear function `C * x0` is the function itself, `C * x0`. This formula is a polynomial function of degree 1, as the exponent of `x0` is 1, which is an integer. This satisfies the requirement for the formula to be an exponential or polynomial function with an integer exponent. While linear functions are a subset of polynomial functions, the user's specific note 'X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!' suggests a distinction for classification. Therefore, the `type_of_equation` is 'linear'. The complexity of a linear function is `O(x0)`.",
