  "reasoning": "1.  **Interpretation of K:** The problem states 'K is large' and requires the upper bound to be 'an exponential function or a polynomial function with integer exponent'. For `x^K` to be a polynomial function with an integer exponent, K must be a positive integer. Since K is 'large', it implies K > 1, making `x^K` a polynomial of degree K. If K were a large real number but not an integer, `x^K` would be a power function, which is not strictly a polynomial (unless K is an integer) nor an exponential function (which is of the form `a^x`). Therefore, we assume K is a large positive integer.\n2.  **Type of Equation:** Given K is a large positive integer, the expression `1.0000015 * x^K` is a polynomial function. The constant factor `1.0000015` does not change its fundamental type or growth rate.\n3.  **Least Upper Bound Formula:** The least upper bound for any function `f(x)` is `f(x)` itself. This is because `f(x) <= f(x)` is always true, and no function `g(x)` that is strictly less than `f(x)` for all `x` can serve as an upper bound for `f(x)`. Thus, the least upper bound formula for `1.0000015 * x^K` is `1.0000015 * x^K`.\n4.  **Explanation for Upper Bound:** The formula `1.0000015 * x^K` is exactly the given expression. Therefore, it trivially satisfies the condition `1.0000015 * x^K <= (1.0000015 * x^K)`. It is the *least* upper bound because no function that grows slower than or is strictly less than `1.0000015 * x^K` can consistently bound it from above.\n5.  **Complexity of the Upper Bound Formula:** In complexity theory, the Big O notation describes the asymptotic upper bound of a function's growth rate. For a polynomial function `c * x^K`, where `c` is a constant and `K` is the highest degree, the complexity is `O(x^K)`. Constant factors are ignored in Big O notation.",
