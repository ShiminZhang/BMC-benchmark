  "reasoning": "The given expression `1.7165105e - 5 * x0` is a linear function of `x0`, which can be written as `C * x0` where `C = 1.7165105 * 10^-5` is a positive constant. According to the user's definition, `X^K` with `K<=1` is considered linear, not polynomial. Therefore, the `type_of_equation` is 'linear'.\n\nFor a function `f(x) = C * x` (with `C > 0`), the least upper bound is the function itself. Any function that grows asymptotically slower or has a smaller constant factor would not be a valid upper bound or the 'least' upper bound, respectively. Thus, `1.7165105e - 5 * x0` is its own least upper bound.\n\nThe user's constraint regarding the `llm_upper_bound` being 'exponential' or 'polynomial with integer exponent' (where exponent > 1) is interpreted in light of their example `\"x + 5\"`, which is linear. This suggests that linear functions are acceptable as upper bounds when the original function is linear, and the constraint applies to the general categories of functions. The complexity of a linear function `C * x0` is `O(x0)` in Big-O notation, as constant factors are disregarded.",
