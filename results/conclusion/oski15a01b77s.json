  "reasoning": "1.  **Simplify the Expression**: The given expression is `- 0.008403643 * K * exp(x0 * K * ( - 0.94703716)) * x0 * K * exp(x0 * K * ( - 0.94703716))`. This can be simplified by combining terms:\\n    Let `C1 = -0.008403643` and `C2 = -0.94703716`.\\n    The expression becomes `(C1 * x0) * K^2 * exp(2 * C2 * x0 * K)`.\\n\\n2.  **Analyze Behavior based on `x0`**: The behavior of the function as `K` becomes large depends critically on the sign of `x0`.\\n    *   If `x0 > 0`: The coefficient `(C1 * x0)` is negative, and the exponent `(2 * C2 * x0)` is also negative. The function takes the form `(negative) * K^2 * exp((negative) * K)`. As `K` approaches infinity, the exponential decay `exp((negative) * K)` dominates the polynomial growth `K^2`, causing the entire term `K^2 * exp((negative) * K)` to approach 0. Since the leading coefficient is negative, the function approaches 0 from the negative side. The least upper bound in this case is 0.\\n    *   If `x0 < 0`: The coefficient `(C1 * x0)` is positive (negative * negative), and the exponent `(2 * C2 * x0)` is also positive (2 * negative * negative). The function takes the form `(positive) * K^2 * exp((positive) * K)`. As `K` approaches infinity, both `K^2` and `exp((positive) * K)` grow without bound, with the exponential term growing much faster. Therefore, the function grows without bound to positive infinity.\\n    *   If `x0 = 0`: The expression evaluates to 0.\\n\\n3.  **Determine the Least Upper Bound Formula**: In complexity theory, when discussing upper bounds, we typically focus on the scenario where the function exhibits growth, as this represents the dominant or",
