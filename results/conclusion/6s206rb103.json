    "reasoning": "The given expression is `1.7237602e - 5 * x0 * * 0.75752515`.\n\n1.  **Interpretation of the expression**: `1.7237602e - 5` is a constant, equivalent to `1.7237602 * 10^-5`. The `* *` operator is interpreted as the power operator `**` based on your clarification that `2**2` means `2^2`. Therefore, `x0 * * 0.75752515` means `x0 ** 0.75752515`, which is `x0^(0.75752515)`. The complete expression can be written as `(1.7237602 * 10^-5) * x0^(0.75752515)`.\n\n2.  **Type of Equation**: You specified that \"X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!\". In our expression, the exponent for `x0` is `0.75752515`. Since `0.75752515 <= 1`, according to your rule, this equation is classified as **linear**.\n\n3.  **Least Upper Bound Formula**: The least upper bound for any function is the function itself, as `f(x) <= f(x)` is always true. This provides the tightest possible bound. Therefore, the least upper bound formula is the expression itself: `1.7237602e-5 * x0^0.75752515`.\n\n4.  **Explanation of Upper Bound**: The formula `1.7237602e-5 * x0^0.75752515` precisely represents the value of the given expression. By definition, any value is less than or equal to itself, making this the exact and thus the least upper bound.\n\n5.  **Complexity Analysis**: The complexity of a power function `C * x^p` (where `C` is a positive constant and `p` is a positive constant) is `O(x^p)`. In this case, the exponent `p = 0.75752515`. Therefore, the asymptotic complexity of the upper bound formula is `O(x0^0.75752515)`. This is the tightest asymptotic upper bound. The phrase \"when K is large\" implies we are considering the asymptotic behavior for large values of `x0`.",
