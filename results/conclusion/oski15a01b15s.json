  "reasoning": "The given equation is `f(x0) = C * x0`, where `C = 3.72799350056852e - 7`. This is a linear function. As per the user's definition ('X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!'), the `type_of_equation` for the given expression is 'linear'.\n\nThe request for the 'least upper bound formula' is constrained to be either an exponential function or a polynomial function with an integer exponent greater than 1. Since `C * x0` is linear, it does not fit these specified types.\n\nTo find the 'least' upper bound formula that *does* fit the specified types, we consider the growth rates of allowed functions:\n1.  Polynomial functions with integer exponent `k > 1`: The slowest growing among these is `x0**2` (for `k=2`).\n2.  Exponential functions: These grow faster than any polynomial function for large `x0`.\n\nTherefore, `x0**2` is the 'least' upper bound formula that satisfies the type constraints. For sufficiently large `x0` (specifically, `x0 >= C`), `C * x0 <= x0**2` holds true. Since `C` is a very small positive constant, this condition is met for all practical 'large' values of `x0`.\n\nThe complexity of the upper bound formula `x0**2` is `O(x0**2)`.",
