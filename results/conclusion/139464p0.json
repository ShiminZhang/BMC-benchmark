    "reasoning": "1.  **Identify the expression**: The given expression is `3.2400476e - 7 * x0`. Let `C = 3.2400476 * 10^-7`. The expression is `f(x0) = C * x0`.\n2.  **Analyze the context**: `C` is a positive constant. In complexity theory, `x0` (representing input size) is typically assumed to be a non-negative variable (`x0 >= 0`). The phrase 'when K is large' implies we are considering the asymptotic behavior for large values of the input variable, which we take to be `x0` since `K` is not in the expression.\n3.  **Determine the type of equation**: The function `f(x0) = C * x0` is a linear function. It is also a polynomial of degree 1 (since `x0 = x0^1`). The prompt requires the upper bound formula to be an exponential or polynomial function with an integer exponent. A linear function fits the description of a polynomial function with an integer exponent (1).\n4.  **Find the least upper bound**: For a monotonically increasing function `f(x0)` with `C > 0` and `x0 >= 0`, the least upper bound is the function itself. This is because `f(x0) <= f(x0)` is always true, making `f(x0)` an upper bound. It is the 'least' because any function `g(x0)` such that `g(x0) < f(x0)` for sufficiently large `x0` cannot be an upper bound for `f(x0)`.\n5.  **Explain why it is the upper bound**: The formula `3.2400476e - 7 * x0` is an upper bound for `3.2400476e - 7 * x0` because any value of the expression is trivially less than or equal to itself. It is the *least* upper bound because it is the tightest possible bound; no function that grows asymptotically slower than `C * x0` can serve as an upper bound for `C * x0` for all large `x0`.\n6.  **Analyze complexity**: The complexity of the upper bound formula `C * x0` is `O(x0)`, which denotes linear time complexity.",
