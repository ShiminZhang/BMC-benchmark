  "reasoning": "The given expression is `f(x0) = -1.05818280499672e-13 * x0 * * 2`. \nLet `C = -1.05818280499672e-13`. This is a negative constant.\nInterpreting `x0 * * 2` as `x0^2` (based on the provided context `** means power 2**2 is 2^2`), the function becomes `f(x0) = C * x0^2`.\n\nThis is a quadratic function (a parabola) with a negative leading coefficient (`C < 0`). A parabola with a negative leading coefficient opens downwards, meaning its vertex represents the maximum value of the function.\n\nThe vertex of `f(x0) = C * x0^2` occurs at `x0 = 0`. \nAt `x0 = 0`, `f(0) = C * (0)^2 = 0`.\n\nFor any other real value of `x0` (i.e., `x0 != 0`), `x0^2` will be a positive number. Since `C` is negative, the product `C * x0^2` will be a negative number.\n\nTherefore, `f(x0) <= 0` for all real `x0`. The maximum value the function can attain is `0`, which it reaches at `x0 = 0`. This maximum value is the least upper bound.\n\nThe condition \"when K is large\" is irrelevant as `K` does not appear in the expression.",
