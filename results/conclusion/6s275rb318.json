    "reasoning": "The given expression is `- 1.3612861980501e - 14 * x0 * * 2`. Let `C = - 1.3612861980501e - 14`. `C` is a negative constant.\n\nBased on the user's clarification `** means power 2**2 is 2^2`, the phrase `* * 2` is interpreted as `**2` (power of 2). Therefore, the expression represents the function `f(x0) = C * x0^2`.\n\nThis function `f(x0)` is a quadratic function, which describes a parabola. Since the coefficient `C` is negative, the parabola opens downwards. The maximum value of such a parabola occurs at its vertex.\n\nFor `f(x0) = C * x0^2`, the vertex is located at `x0 = 0`. At this point, the function's value is `f(0) = C * (0)^2 = 0`.\n\nFor any other real value of `x0` (i.e., `x0 \u2260 0`), `x0^2` will be a positive value. Since `C` is a negative constant, the product `C * x0^2` will always be a negative value.\n\nTherefore, for all real values of `x0`, `f(x0) \u2264 0`. The highest value that `f(x0)` can attain is `0`. This makes `0` the least upper bound for the function.\n\nThe phrase 'when K is large' is not relevant to the given expression as the variable `K` is not present in the formula.",
