  "reasoning": "The given expression is interpreted as `f(x0) = -9.357354e-7 * x0^0.9713774`. Let `C = -9.357354e-7` and `P = 0.9713774`. The function is `f(x0) = C * x0^P`.\n\n1.  **Function Behavior**: For real-valued results, `x0` is assumed to be non-negative (`x0 >= 0`). Since `C` is a negative constant and `x0^P` is non-negative for `x0 >= 0`, the function `f(x0)` will always be less than or equal to zero.\n2.  **Maximum Value**: The function `f(x0)` attains its maximum value at `x0 = 0`, where `f(0) = -9.357354e-7 * 0^0.9713774 = 0`. For any `x0 > 0`, `f(x0)` will be strictly negative. Therefore, the least upper bound (supremum) of the function is `0`.\n3.  **Type of Equation**: The problem states, \"X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!\". The exponent `0.9713774` is less than or equal to 1. Thus, according to the problem's definition, this equation is classified as 'linear'.\n4.  **Upper Bound Formula**: The least upper bound is `0`. This is a constant function, which can be expressed as a polynomial of degree 0 (e.g., `0 * x^0` or simply `0`).\n5.  **Complexity**: The upper bound `0` is a constant. The complexity of a constant value is `O(1)`.",
