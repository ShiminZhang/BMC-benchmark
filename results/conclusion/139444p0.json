    "reasoning": "The given equation is `f(x0) = 3.5487665e - 7 * x0`. Let `C = 3.5487665e - 7`. Thus, the equation is `f(x0) = C * x0`.\n\n1.  **Type of Equation**: Based on the user's specific instruction, 'X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!', the function `f(x0) = C * x0` (where `x0` has an exponent of 1) is classified as a **linear** function.\n\n2.  **Least Upper Bound Formula**: For a positive constant `C` and a non-negative variable `x0` (standard assumptions in complexity theory), the least upper bound for the function `f(x0) = C * x0` is the function itself. This means that for all `x0`, `f(x0) <= C * x0`, and no asymptotically tighter upper bound exists. The formula `C * x0` is a polynomial function of degree 1 (with an integer exponent of 1 for `x0`), which satisfies the requirement that the upper bound formula be 'an exponential function or a polynomial function with integer exponent' under standard mathematical definitions. We interpret the user's specific classification rule ('X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!') as applying to the `type_of_equation` field, not as a restriction on the mathematical form of the `upper_bound` itself, to ensure we provide the *least* upper bound.\n\n3.  **Irrelevance of K**: The phrase 'when K is large' is not relevant to the given equation `3.5487665e - 7 * x0` as the variable `K` does not appear in the expression.\n\n4.  **Complexity of the Upper Bound Formula**: The upper bound formula is `g(x0) = 3.5487665e - 7 * x0`. The complexity of this function is **O(x0)**, indicating that its growth rate is directly proportional to `x0`.",
