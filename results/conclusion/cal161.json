    "reasoning": "The given expression is `f(x0) = 2.49107715971881e - 5 * x0`. Let `C = 2.49107715971881e - 5`. This is a linear function of `x0`.\n\n1.  **Type of Equation:** Based on the provided rule \"X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!\", a function with `x0` raised to the power of 1 is classified as 'linear'.\n\n2.  **Least Upper Bound:** For a positive constant `C` and non-negative `x0`, the function `f(x0) = C * x0` is its own least upper bound. This means that no function that grows slower than `C * x0` can serve as an upper bound, and `C * x0` itself is the tightest possible upper bound.\n\n3.  **Formula Format:** The requirement states that the upper bound formula must be an exponential function or a polynomial function with an integer exponent. `C * x0` is a polynomial function where `x0` is raised to the integer exponent 1. This satisfies the format requirement for the `upper_bound` string.\n\n4.  **Complexity:** The asymptotic complexity of a linear function `C * x0` is `O(x0)`.\n\n5.  **'K is large'**: The phrase \"when K is large\" is irrelevant to the given expression, as `K` is not present in `2.49107715971881e - 5 * x0`.",
