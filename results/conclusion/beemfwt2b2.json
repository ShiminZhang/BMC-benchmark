    "reasoning": "1.  **Interpretation of the Expression:** The given expression is `6.26955683506886e - 12 * x0 * * 1.7737339`. The `* *` sequence is ambiguous. However, the problem explicitly states `** means power` and introduces `K` with a rule about `X^K` being linear or polynomial. The most consistent interpretation that incorporates all these elements is that `K` is the exponent of `x0`, and `1.7737339` is a constant multiplier. Therefore, the expression is interpreted as `(6.26955683506886e - 12) * x0 ** K * (1.7737339)`. \\n2.  **Simplification:** Let `C1 = 6.26955683506886e - 12` and `C2 = 1.7737339`. The expression simplifies to `(C1 * C2) * x0 ** K`. Calculating the combined constant: `C = C1 * C2 = 6.26955683506886e-12 * 1.7737339 = 1.112663009968498e-11`. So, the function is `f(x0) = 1.112663009968498e-11 * x0 ** K`.\\n3.  **Type of Equation:** The problem states",
