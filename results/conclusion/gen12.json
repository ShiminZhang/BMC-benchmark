  "reasoning": "The given expression is `f(x0) = (2.8456564 * 10^-9) * x0^(1.5357568)`. We are asked for its least upper bound formula when `x0` (assumed to be the variable that becomes large, as `K` is not in the expression) is large.\n\nThe prompt imposes a strict condition on the form of the upper bound formula: it must be either an exponential function or a polynomial function with an integer exponent. The given function `f(x0)` is a power function. It is not an exponential function (which would be of the form `a^x0`). It is also not a polynomial function with an integer exponent because its exponent, `1.5357568`, is not an integer.\n\nTo satisfy the requirement for an integer exponent, we must find the smallest integer `p` such that `x0^p` serves as an upper bound for `x0^1.5357568` for sufficiently large `x0`. The exponent `1.5357568` lies between `1` and `2`.\n\n*   A polynomial with exponent `1` (e.g., `x0^1`) would not be an upper bound for `x0^1.5357568` for large `x0`, as `x0^1.5357568` grows faster than `x0^1` for `x0 > 1`.\n*   A polynomial with exponent `2` (e.g., `x0^2`) *is* an upper bound for `x0^1.5357568` for large `x0`. Specifically, for `x0 > 1`, `x0^1.5357568 < x0^2`.\n\nTherefore, the smallest integer exponent that provides a valid upper bound is `2`. The least upper bound formula that adheres to the specified format constraints is `(2.8456564 * 10^-9) * x0^2`. This is a polynomial function with an integer exponent (2).\n\nThe complexity of this upper bound formula is `O(x0^2)`.",
