  "reasoning": "The number 0.0800000000000000 is a constant. The least upper bound (supremum) of a set containing a single constant value 'c' is 'c' itself. Therefore, the least upper bound of the number 0.0800000000000000 is 0.08. The phrase 'when K is large' does not alter the value of this constant. To express this as a 'formula' involving K, while maintaining its constant value, we use a constant function: f(K) = 0.08. This function is an upper bound because for any value K, f(K) = 0.08, and 0.08 is greater than or equal to the number 0.08. It is the *least* upper bound because no number smaller than 0.08 can be an upper bound for 0.08. A constant function f(K) = C is a polynomial function of degree 0 (e.g., 0.08 * K^0), which fits the requirement for a polynomial function with an integer exponent. The constraint 'X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!' refers to the exponent of the variable X, not the degree of the polynomial in K. Here, the exponent of K is 0, which is an integer, making it a polynomial.",
