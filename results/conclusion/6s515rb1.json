    "reasoning": "The given expression is `f(x0) = C * x0`, where `C = 3.7218724e - 5` is a positive constant. This is a linear function of `x0`. In the context of complexity theory, the 'least upper bound formula' for a function `f(x0)` refers to the tightest function `g(x0)` such that `f(x0) <= g(x0)` for all `x0` in the domain (typically `x0 >= 0` for input sizes). For a linear function with a positive slope, `f(x0) = C * x0`, the function itself is its own least upper bound. Any function `g(x0)` that is strictly greater than `f(x0)` for all `x0` would not be the 'least' upper bound. The expression `C * x0` is a polynomial function with an integer exponent (1 for `x0`), satisfying the specified format requirement. The phrase 'when K is large' is irrelevant to the functional form of the given expression, as `K` is not a variable in `3.7218724e - 5 * x0`. The complexity of a linear function `C * x0` is `O(x0)`, which also applies to its least upper bound formula.",
