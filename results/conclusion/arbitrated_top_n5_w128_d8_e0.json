The expression can be written as `f(x0) = C * x0`.\\n\\n1.  **Type of Equation:** This is a linear function of `x0`. In mathematics, linear functions are a specific type of polynomial function, specifically, polynomials of degree 1 (e.g., `ax^1 + b`). The problem statement includes a potentially confusing clarification:",
