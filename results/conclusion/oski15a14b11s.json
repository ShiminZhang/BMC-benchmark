  "reasoning": "The given expression is `f(x0) = 4.02375e - 7 * x0`. Let `C = 4.02375 * 10^-7`. So, `f(x0) = C * x0`. This is a linear function of `x0`. A linear function is a polynomial function of degree 1, which satisfies the requirement for the formula to be 'an exponential function or a polynomial function with integer exponent' (here, the integer exponent is 1). The 'least upper bound' for a function is the tightest possible upper bound. For a function `f(x0)`, `f(x0)` itself serves as its own least upper bound. Therefore, the formula `4.02375e - 7 * x0` is the least upper bound. The phrase 'when K is large' does not affect the structure of this specific expression, as `K` is not a variable or exponent within `4.02375e - 7 * x0`. The complexity of a linear function `C * x0` is `O(x0)`.",
