    "reasoning": "The given expression is `f(x0) = 0.5481537 * exp(exp(0.21627864 * x0^(0.15578444)))`. As `x0` (or `K` if `x0` is replaced by `K`) becomes large, the term `x0^(0.15578444)` grows unboundedly. This leads to a nested exponential structure, specifically a double exponential function. Double exponential functions grow significantly faster than any single exponential function (e.g., `exp(x)`) or any polynomial function (e.g., `x^k`).\\n\\n1.  **Type of Equation**: The function is a double exponential.
