  "reasoning": "The given expression is `5.1475662 * x0 * * 2 * exp(x0 * * ( - 264.0593))`. Following the instruction that `**` denotes exponentiation (e.g., `2**2` is `2^2`), we interpret the formula as:\\n\\n`f(x0) = 5.1475662 * x0^2 * exp(x0^(-264.0593))`\\n\\nLet `C = 5.1475662` and `A = 264.0593`. The function can be written as:\\n`f(x0) = C * x0^2 * exp(1 / x0^A)`\\n\\nWe are interested in the behavior of this function when `x0` is large (as implied by \\",
