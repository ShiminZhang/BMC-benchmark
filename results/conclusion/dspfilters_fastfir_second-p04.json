  "reasoning": "The given expression is `f(x0) = 9.03019775994637e - 7 * x0`. Let `C = 9.03019775994637e - 7`. The expression is `f(x0) = C * x0`.\n\n**Analysis of the expression:** This is a linear function of `x0`. The constant `C` is a positive real number.\n\n**Influence of K:** The variable `K` is not present in the expression `C * x0`. Therefore, the condition 'when K is large' does not affect the form or value of the least upper bound formula for this specific expression.\n\n**Least Upper Bound Formula:** For any function `f(x)`, the tightest (least) upper bound is the function itself, `f(x)`, as `f(x) <= f(x)` is always true. Thus, the least upper bound formula for `9.03019775994637e - 7 * x0` is `9.03019775994637e - 7 * x0`.\n\n**Formula Type Check:** The formula `C * x0` is a polynomial function of degree 1, with an integer exponent (1) for `x0`. This satisfies the requirement for the formula to be 'an exponential function or a polynomial function with integer exponent'.\n\n**Complexity of the Upper Bound Formula:** The complexity of the function `g(x0) = C * x0` is `O(x0)`. This indicates that the growth rate of the function is directly proportional to `x0` for sufficiently large `x0`.",
