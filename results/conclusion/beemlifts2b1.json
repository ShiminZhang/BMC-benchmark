  "reasoning": "The given expression is `f(x0) = -0.9243703 / (x0 ^ 2.1714964)`. We are asked for its least upper bound when `x0` (interpreted as 'K' being large) tends to infinity.\n\n1.  **Domain**: For `x0 ^ 2.1714964` to be a real number, `x0` must be positive. Thus, we consider the behavior of `f(x0)` as `x0` approaches positive infinity.\n2.  **Behavior as `x0 -> infinity`**: As `x0` becomes very large, `x0 ^ 2.1714964` also becomes very large (tends to `+infinity`). Consequently, the reciprocal `1 / (x0 ^ 2.1714964)` approaches `0`.\n3.  **Sign of the function**: The numerator `-0.9243703` is a negative constant. The denominator `x0 ^ 2.1714964` is always positive for `x0 > 0`. Therefore, the entire expression `f(x0)` is always negative for `x0 > 0`.\n4.  **Upper bound**: Since `f(x0)` is always negative and approaches `0` as `x0` tends to infinity, `0` serves as an upper bound for the function. That is, `f(x0) < 0` for all `x0 > 0`.\n5.  **Least upper bound**: Because `f(x0)` approaches `0` arbitrarily closely from the negative side as `x0` increases, `0` is the smallest possible upper bound. Any number smaller than `0` would eventually be exceeded by `f(x0)` as `x0` gets large enough (e.g., `f(x0)` could be `-0.0001`, which is greater than `-0.001`). Therefore, `0` is the least upper bound (supremum) of the function's values as `x0` becomes large.\n6.  **Formula type**: The formula `0` is a constant function, which is a polynomial of degree 0 (e.g., `P(x) = 0`). This satisfies the requirement for a polynomial function with an integer exponent.",
