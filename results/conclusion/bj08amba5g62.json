    "reasoning": "1.  **Analyze the expression**: The given expression is `4.0478e - 7 * x0`. This can be written as `C * x0`, where `C = 4.0478 * 10^-7` is a positive constant. This is a simple linear function of `x0`. \n2.  **Role of K**: The variable `K` does not appear in the expression `C * x0`. The phrase 'when K is large' is likely a distractor or implies that `x0` can be arbitrarily large, which is the standard context for discussing asymptotic upper bounds in complexity theory. Assuming `x0` is the independent variable, `K` does not alter the form or behavior of the function with respect to `x0`.\n3.  **Type of equation**: According to the problem's specific definition, 'X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!'. Since `x0` is effectively `x0^1`, the expression `C * x0` is classified as a 'linear' function.\n4.  **Least Upper Bound Formula**: For a function `f(x0) = C * x0` where `C > 0`, the function itself is the tightest possible upper bound. Any function `g(x0)` that is an upper bound must satisfy `g(x0) >= f(x0)` for sufficiently large `x0`. The 'least' such upper bound is `f(x0)` itself. Therefore, the least upper bound formula is `4.0478e - 7 * x0`.\n5.  **Why it is the upper bound**: For any value of `x0`, the expression `4.0478e - 7 * x0` is exactly equal to itself. Thus, it trivially satisfies the condition of being greater than or equal to itself, making it the tightest possible upper bound.\n6.  **Complexity**: The asymptotic complexity of a linear function `C * x0` is `O(x0)`. This means that for sufficiently large `x0`, the function grows at most proportionally to `x0`.",
