  "reasoning": "The given expression is interpreted as `f(x0, K) = -1.35359234638446 * exp(x0 * K * 0.20000052) * K * 0.22361185`. Let `A = -1.35359234638446 * 0.22361185` (a negative constant) and `B = 0.20000052` (a positive constant). The expression simplifies to `f(x0, K) = A * K * exp(x0 * B * K)`.\n\nWe analyze the behavior of `f(x0, K)` as `K` becomes large, considering the sign of `x0`:\n1.  **If `x0 > 0`**: The term `x0 * B * K` goes to `+infinity`, so `exp(x0 * B * K)` grows exponentially. Since `A` is negative, `f(x0, K)` goes to `-infinity`.\n2.  **If `x0 < 0`**: The term `x0 * B * K` goes to `-infinity`, so `exp(x0 * B * K)` goes to `0`. The product `K * exp(x0 * B * K)` approaches `0` as `K` grows (exponential decay dominates polynomial growth). Since `A` is negative, `f(x0, K)` approaches `0` from the negative side.\n3.  **If `x0 = 0`**: The term `exp(x0 * B * K)` becomes `exp(0) = 1`. The expression simplifies to `f(0, K) = A * K`. Since `A` is negative, `f(0, K)` goes to `-infinity`.\n\nIn all cases, the function `f(x0, K)` is always negative for `K > 0` and either tends to `-infinity` or approaches `0` from the negative side. Therefore, the least upper bound (supremum) of the function is `0`.\n\nThe upper bound formula `0` is a constant function, which is a polynomial of degree 0. Its computational complexity is `O(1)`.",
