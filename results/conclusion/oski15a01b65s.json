  "reasoning": "The given expression is `9.7451405e-8 * x0 ** 1.0777433`. We interpret `x0` as the variable `K` that becomes large. Let `C = 9.7451405e-8` and `alpha = 1.0777433`. The function is `f(K) = C * K^alpha`.\n\n1.  **Type of Equation:** Since `alpha = 1.0777433` is a constant greater than 1, and the problem statement implies that `X^K` with `K > 1` is considered polynomial (as `K <= 1` is linear), this is a polynomial function.\n\n2.  **Least Upper Bound Formula:** The exact asymptotic behavior of `f(K)` is `O(K^1.0777433)`. However, the problem requires the formula to have an *integer exponent*. To find the *least upper bound* with an integer exponent, we must find the smallest integer `j` such that `K^alpha = O(K^j)`. This means `j` must be greater than or equal to `alpha`. For `alpha = 1.0777433`, the smallest integer `j` is `ceil(1.0777433) = 2`. Therefore, `K^2` is the least upper bound with an integer exponent.\n\n3.  **Why it is the upper bound:** For sufficiently large `K`, `K^1.0777433` grows slower than `K^2`. Specifically, `lim (K->inf) (K^1.0777433 / K^2) = lim (K->inf) (K^(1.0777433 - 2)) = lim (K->inf) (K^-0.9222567) = 0`. This means `K^1.0777433` is `o(K^2)` (little-o), which implies `K^1.0777433 = O(K^2)`. `K^1` is not an upper bound because `K^1.0777433` grows faster than `K^1`. Thus, `K^2` is the tightest integer-exponent upper bound.",
