    "reasoning": "The expression provided is `1.49999999976558e - 6 * x0`. This is a direct multiplication of a positive constant (`1.49999999976558e - 6`) by a variable (`x0`). This form, `C * x0`, represents a linear function. The condition 'K is large' is not applicable to the given expression as `K` does not appear as an exponent or any other parameter within `1.49999999976558e - 6 * x0`. According to the problem's definition, `X^K` with `K<=1` is considered linear. Since `x0` has an implicit exponent of 1, the function is linear. For a linear function `f(x) = C * x`, where `C > 0` and assuming `x0` is non-negative, the function itself is the tightest possible upper bound. Therefore, the least upper bound formula is the expression itself. The time complexity of evaluating or describing the growth of a linear function is proportional to its input, hence `O(x0)`.",
