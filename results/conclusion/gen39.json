  "reasoning": "The given expression is `7.83983e - 8 * x0 * * 1.3164399`. The prompt defines `**` as the power operator but does not define `* *`. Therefore, `* *` is interpreted as two separate multiplication operators. This simplifies the expression to `(7.83983e - 8) * x0 * 1.3164399`. \n\nLet `C_prime = 7.83983e - 8 * 1.3164399`. \n`C_prime = 0.0000000783983 * 1.3164399 = 0.00000010308000000000001 = 1.0308000000000001e-07`.\n\nThe function is `f(x0) = C_prime * x0`. This is a function of the form `X^K` where `K=1`. According to the problem's definition, \"X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!\". Thus, the type of equation is **linear**.\n\nThe phrase \"when K is large\" is irrelevant as the variable `K` is not present in the given expression. The least upper bound formula for a linear function `C_prime * x0` is `C_prime * x0` itself. The complexity of a linear function is `O(x0)`.",
