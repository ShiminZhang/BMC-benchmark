    "reasoning": "The given expression is `f(x0) = 2.8517185e - 5 * x0`. Let `C = 2.8517185 * 10^-5`. The function is `f(x0) = C * x0`. This is a linear function, which is a specific type of polynomial function with degree 1. \n\nIn complexity theory, the 'least upper bound formula' for a function `f(x0)` is a function `g(x0)` such that `f(x0) = O(g(x0))` and `g(x0)` represents the tightest possible growth rate. For a linear function `f(x0) = C * x0` where `C` is a positive constant, the tightest asymptotic upper bound is `O(x0)`.\n\nTo demonstrate `f(x0) = O(x0)`:\nWe need to find positive constants `M` and `x_0` such that `|f(x0)| <= M * |x0|` for all `x0 >= x_0`. \nGiven `f(x0) = C * x0` and `C = 2.8517185 * 10^-5` (which is a positive constant), and assuming `x0` is a non-negative input (standard in complexity analysis):\n`C * x0 <= M * x0`\nWe can choose `M = C` (e.g., `M = 2.8517185 * 10^-5`) and `x_0 = 0`. \nThen, `2.8517185 * 10^-5 * x0 <= 2.8517185 * 10^-5 * x0` for all `x0 >= 0`, which is trivially true.\n\nTherefore, `x0` serves as the least upper bound formula. It is a polynomial function with an integer exponent (1).\n\nThe phrase 'when K is large' is not directly relevant to the form of the given expression `C * x0`, as the exponent of `x0` is 1, which is not 'large'. The expression itself is already in its simplest polynomial form for analysis.",
