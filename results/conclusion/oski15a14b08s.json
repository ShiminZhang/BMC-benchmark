  "reasoning": "The given expression is `f(x) = 2.2618088711944e - 5 * x0`. Let's denote the constant `C = 2.2618088711944e - 5` and the variable `x0` as `x`. So, the expression is `f(x) = C * x`.\n\n1.  **Irrelevance of K:** The variable `K` is mentioned as 'large' but does not appear in the expression `C * x`. Therefore, `K` has no bearing on the value, type, or upper bound of this specific function.\n2.  **Type of Equation:** The function `f(x) = C * x` is a linear function. It is also a polynomial function of degree 1, which satisfies the requirement for a polynomial function with an integer exponent.\n3.  **Least Upper Bound Formula:** For a function `f(x)`, the 'least upper bound formula' refers to the tightest possible function `g(x)` such that `g(x) >= f(x)` for all relevant values of `x`. The tightest such function is `f(x)` itself. Therefore, the least upper bound formula for `2.2618088711944e - 5 * x` is `2.2618088711944e - 5 * x`.\n4.  **Why it is the upper bound:** The formula `g(x) = 2.2618088711944e - 5 * x` is an upper bound because `g(x) >= f(x)` (i.e., `C * x >= C * x`) is always true. It is the *least* upper bound because any function `h(x)` that is strictly less than `C * x` for any `x` cannot serve as an upper bound for `f(x)` over its entire domain.\n5.  **Complexity:** In complexity theory, the growth rate of a linear function `C * x` (where `C` is a positive constant) is `O(x)`. Constant factors are typically ignored in Big-O notation.",
