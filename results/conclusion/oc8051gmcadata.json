  "reasoning": "The given expression is `x^0.25921398`. Let `f(x) = x^0.25921398`. We are looking for a 'least upper bound formula' that is either an exponential function or a polynomial function with an integer exponent.\n\n1.  **Analysis of `f(x)`**: The exponent `0.25921398` is a positive real number less than 1. This means `f(x)` grows slower than any linear function `ax+b` for `a>0` and `x` large. Specifically, `f(x)` grows slower than `x`.\n\n2.  **Candidate Upper Bounds (Exponential)**: An exponential function `g(x) = a^x` (for `a > 1`) grows significantly faster than any power function `x^p`. While `a^x` would be an upper bound for `f(x)`, it would not be the 'least' upper bound because `f(x) = o(a^x)` (meaning `f(x)` grows much slower than `a^x`).\n\n3.  **Candidate Upper Bounds (Polynomial with Integer Exponent)**:\n    *   If we choose `g(x) = x^k` where `k` is an integer:\n        *   For `k=0`, `g(x) = x^0 = 1`. This is not an upper bound for `f(x)` for large `x` since `f(x)` grows indefinitely.\n        *   For `k=1`, `g(x) = x^1 = x`. For any `x >= 1`, since `0.25921398 < 1`, it holds that `x^0.25921398 <= x^1`. Thus, `x` is an upper bound for `f(x)` for `x >= 1`.\n        *   For `k > 1` (e.g., `k=2, 3, ...`), `g(x) = x^k`. For `x >= 1`, we have `x^0.25921398 <= x <= x^k`. While `x^k` is an upper bound, `x` is a tighter (or 'least') upper bound compared to `x^k` among the allowed polynomial forms with integer exponents.\n\n4.  **Conclusion for Least Upper Bound Formula**: Among the allowed forms (exponential or polynomial with integer exponent), `x` is the tightest possible upper bound. It satisfies `f(x) <= x` for `x >= 1`.\n\n5.  **Type of Equation**: The problem statement explicitly defines: \"X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!\". Since our upper bound formula is `x` (which is `x^1`), it falls under the 'linear' category according to this definition.\n\n6.  **Complexity**: The complexity of the upper bound formula `x` is `O(x)`.\n",
