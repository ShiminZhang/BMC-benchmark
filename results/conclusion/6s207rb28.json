  "reasoning": "The given expression is `f(x0) = 1.3857498 * x0^2`. This is a polynomial function of degree 2. In complexity theory, when determining the 'least upper bound formula' for a function's growth, we typically identify the dominant term and disregard constant factors, as `O(c * g(x)) = O(g(x))`. The goal is to find the simplest function `g(x0)` such that `f(x0) = O(g(x0))` and `g(x0)` represents the tightest possible asymptotic growth rate. For `f(x0) = 1.3857498 * x0^2`, the dominant term is `x0^2`. Therefore, `x0^2` is the least upper bound formula in terms of asymptotic growth. This formula is a polynomial function with an integer exponent (2), satisfying the requirements. The phrase 'when K is large' implies an asymptotic analysis, where `x0` is considered to tend towards infinity.",
