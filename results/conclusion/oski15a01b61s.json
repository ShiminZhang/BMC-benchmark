  "reasoning": "The given expression is `f(x0) = 1.3054314e - 7 * (x0 + exp(1.4166217e - 7 * x0)) * 1.0594491`. Let `A = 1.3054314e - 7 * 1.0594491` and `B = 1.4166217e - 7`. Both `A` and `B` are positive constants. The expression simplifies to `f(x0) = A * x0 + A * exp(B * x0)`.\n\nAs `x0` becomes large (approaching positive infinity), the exponential term `A * exp(B * x0)` dominates the linear term `A * x0` because `B > 0`. Exponential functions grow significantly faster than polynomial functions.\n\nTo find an upper bound formula that is an exponential function, we observe that for `x0 > 0`, `x0 < exp(B * x0)`. Therefore:\n`f(x0) = A * x0 + A * exp(B * x0) < A * exp(B * x0) + A * exp(B * x0) = 2 * A * exp(B * x0)`.\n\nThus, `U(x0) = 2 * A * exp(B * x0)` serves as an upper bound for `f(x0)` for `x0 > 0`. This formula is an exponential function, satisfying the specified format requirement.\n\nThis upper bound is considered 'least' in the context of complexity theory because it shares the same asymptotic growth rate as the original function. The limit of the ratio `f(x0) / U(x0)` as `x0 -> +infinity` is `1/2`, a positive finite constant, indicating `f(x0) = Theta(U(x0))`.\n\nCalculating the constants:\n`A = 1.3054314e-7 * 1.0594491 = 1.3829000000000001e-7`\n`2 * A = 2.7658000000000002e-7`\n`B = 1.4166217e-7`\n\nThe phrase 'when K is large' is noted, but `K` is not present in the given expression. It is assumed the question refers to `x0` being large.",
