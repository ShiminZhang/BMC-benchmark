  "reasoning": "The expression provided is `3.6980208e - 7 * x0`. Let `C = 3.6980208 * 10^-7`. The expression is therefore `C * x0`. This is a linear function of the variable `x0`. A linear function is a specific type of polynomial function, with an integer exponent of 1 for `x0`. \n\nWhen asked for the 'least upper bound formula' of a function `f(x)`, it generally refers to the function `f(x)` itself, as `f(x)` is an upper bound for its own values, and it is the 'least' such function in terms of value. Therefore, the least upper bound formula for `C * x0` is `C * x0`.\n\nThe instruction mentions 'when K is large', but the variable `K` does not appear in the given expression `3.6980208e - 7 * x0`. Thus, `K` is not relevant to determining the formula or its properties in this specific context.\n\nThe formula `3.6980208e - 7 * x0` is a polynomial function (degree 1), which satisfies the requirement that the formula should be either an exponential or a polynomial function with an integer exponent.\n\nThe complexity of this upper bound formula, `C * x0`, is linear, denoted as `O(x0)`, meaning its growth rate is directly proportional to `x0`.",
