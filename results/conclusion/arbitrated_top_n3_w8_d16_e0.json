    "reasoning": "The given expression is `3.7124946e - 7 * x0`. Let `C = 3.7124946 * 10^-7`. The expression can be written as `C * x0`. This is a direct linear relationship with `x0`. The mention of 'K is large' is irrelevant, as the variable `K` does not appear in the expression `C * x0`. For a function `f(x0) = C * x0`, the least upper bound formula that precisely describes its growth is the function itself, `C * x0`. This formula is a polynomial function of `x0` with an integer exponent (specifically, `x0^1`), satisfying the problem's requirement for the form of the upper bound. It is the 'least' upper bound because for any `x0 >= 0` (assuming `x0` is a non-negative quantity, typical in complexity analysis), `f(x0)` is exactly `C * x0`, meaning no tighter upper bound can be found that is not asymptotically equivalent to `C * x0`.",
