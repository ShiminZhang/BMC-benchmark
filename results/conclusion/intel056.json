  "reasoning": "The given expression is `1.3415554e - 7 * x0 * * 1.070247`. Interpreting the notation, `1.3415554e - 7` is a constant `C = 1.3415554 * 10^-7`, and `x0 * * 1.070247` means `x0^(1.070247)`. So the expression is `C * x0^(1.070247)`.\n\nThis is a power function where the exponent `p = 1.070247`. Since `p > 1`, this function exhibits polynomial-like growth. The problem explicitly states that 'X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!', which confirms that an exponent greater than 1 qualifies as polynomial growth.\n\nThe crucial constraint is that the 'formula should either be an exponential function or a polynomial function with integer exponent'. Our current exponent `1.070247` is not an integer. To find the *least* upper bound that satisfies this constraint, we must find the smallest integer `m` such that `x0^m` is an upper bound for `x0^(1.070247)` for large values of `x0` (as implied by 'K is large', suggesting asymptotic analysis).\n\nFor `x0 > 1`, if `m >= p`, then `x0^m >= x0^p`. The smallest integer `m` that is greater than or equal to `1.070247` is `m = 2`. Therefore, `x0^2` is the tightest polynomial with an integer exponent that bounds `x0^(1.070247)` from above for large `x0`.\n\nIncluding the constant `C`, the least upper bound formula that adheres to the specified format is `1.3415554e - 7 * x0^2`. This is a polynomial function with an integer exponent (2).\n\nThe complexity of this upper bound is determined by its highest power, which is `x0^2`.",
