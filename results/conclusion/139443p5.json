    "reasoning": "The given expression is `f(x0) = 6.320862e - 7 * x0`. This is a linear function of `x0` with a positive constant coefficient. A function `g(x0)` is an upper bound for `f(x0)` if `f(x0) <= g(x0)` for all relevant values of `x0`. The 'least upper bound formula' refers to the tightest such function. The function `f(x0)` itself serves as its own least upper bound formula because `f(x0) <= f(x0)` is always true, and no function that grows strictly slower than `f(x0)` can bound it from above for all sufficiently large `x0`. The expression `6.320862e - 7 * x0` is a polynomial function of degree 1 (since `x0` can be written as `x0^1`), which satisfies the requirement for an integer exponent. The mention of `K` in the prompt is a distractor as it is not present in the expression being analyzed.",
