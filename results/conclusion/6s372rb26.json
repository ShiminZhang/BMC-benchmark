    "reasoning": "The given expression is `f(x0) = (1.2365528 * 10^-7) * x0 ^ 1.0561159`. This is a power function where the exponent `P = 1.0561159` is greater than 1 but not an integer. \n\nAccording to the user's specific definitions:\n1.  It is not a 'linear' function because its exponent `1.0561159` is greater than 1.\n2.  It is not a 'polynomial function with integer exponent' because its exponent `1.0561159` is not an integer.\n3.  It is not an 'exponential function' (which would be of the form `a^x0`).\nTherefore, the `type_of_equation` for the given expression is `unknown` based on the provided categories.\n\nFor the 'least upper bound formula', we must provide a formula that is either an exponential function or a polynomial function with an integer exponent. The tightest asymptotic upper bound for `f(x0)` is `O(x0^1.0561159)`. However, this form is not allowed due to the non-integer exponent.\n\nWe need to find the smallest integer exponent `k` such that `x0^k` is an upper bound for `f(x0)` for large `x0`.\n*   For `k=1` (linear, by user's definition), `x0^1.0561159` grows faster than `x0^1`. Thus, `x0^1` is not an upper bound.\n*   For `k=2` (polynomial with integer exponent), `x0^1.0561159` grows slower than `x0^2`. More formally, `lim (x0 -> infinity) [ (1.2365528 * 10^-7 * x0^1.0561159) / x0^2 ] = lim (x0 -> infinity) [ (1.2365528 * 10^-7) / x0^0.9438841 ] = 0`. This means `f(x0)` is `o(x0^2)`, which implies `x0^2` is an upper bound for sufficiently large `x0`.\n\nSince `x0^1` is not an upper bound and `x0^2` is, `x0^2` is the 'least upper bound' that fits the specified format (a polynomial function with an integer exponent).",
