    "reasoning": "The given expression is `4.085951e - 7 * x0`. Let `C = 4.085951e - 7`. The expression is `C * x0`.\n\n1.  **Least Upper Bound Formula**: Assuming `x0` represents a non-negative input size (common in complexity theory), the function `f(x0) = C * x0` is a monotonically increasing function for `C > 0`. The least upper bound for a function `f(x0)` is the function itself, `f(x0)`, because it is the tightest possible bound. Any function `g(x0)` such that `g(x0) < f(x0)` for some `x0` would not be an upper bound, and any function `h(x0)` such that `h(x0) > f(x0)` for all `x0` would be an upper bound but not the *least* one. Thus, the least upper bound formula is `4.085951e - 7 * x0`.\n2.  **Type of Equation**: The expression `C * x0` is a linear function (a polynomial of degree 1). According to the problem's specific instruction, \"X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!\", this expression falls into the 'linear' category.\n3.  **Complexity**: The upper bound formula `4.085951e - 7 * x0` grows proportionally to `x0`. Therefore, its asymptotic complexity is `O(x0)`.\n4.  **'K is large'**: The variable `K` is not present in the expression `4.085951e - 7 * x0`. Its value, whether large or small, does not influence the form or behavior of this specific expression with respect to `x0`.",
