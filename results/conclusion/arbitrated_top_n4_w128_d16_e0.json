    "reasoning": "The given expression is `f(x0) = 3.3896396e - 7 * x0`. Let `C = 3.3896396e - 7`. So, `f(x0) = C * x0`.\n\n1.  **Irrelevance of K:** The variable `K` is not present in the expression `C * x0`. Therefore, the condition 'when K is large' is irrelevant to determining the upper bound of this specific function.\n\n2.  **Type of Equation:** The function `f(x0) = C * x0` is a linear function. Following your specific instruction, 'X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!', this equation is classified as 'linear'.\n\n3.  **Least Upper Bound Formula:** For a function `f(x)`, the least upper bound formula is `f(x)` itself, as `f(x) <= f(x)` is always true, and no other function can be a tighter upper bound without being identical to `f(x)`. Thus, the least upper bound formula for `3.3896396e - 7 * x0` is `3.3896396e - 7 * x0`.\n\n4.  **Complexity of the Upper Bound:** The upper bound formula `3.3896396e - 7 * x0` is a linear function of `x0`. In complexity theory, a linear function `C * x0` has a time complexity of `O(x0)`.",
