    "reasoning": "The given expression is `4.5265064e - 5 * x0`. Let `C = 4.5265064 * 10^-5`. The expression can be written as `C * x0`.\\n\\n1.  **Type of Equation**: This is a linear function of `x0`. Linear functions are a specific type of polynomial function where the highest power of the variable is 1. Thus, it is a polynomial function with an integer exponent (1), which satisfies the problem",
