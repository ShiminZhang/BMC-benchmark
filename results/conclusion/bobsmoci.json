    "reasoning": "The given expression is `f(x0) = 0.00136728334317326 * exp(x0^(0.19356444))`. Let `C = 0.00136728334317326` and `alpha = 0.19356444`. The function can be written as `f(x0) = C * exp(x0^alpha)`. \\n\\n1.  **Type of Equation**: Since the variable `x0` appears in the exponent of `e` (specifically, `e` is raised to a power of `x0`), this is an **exponential function**. It grows faster than any polynomial function for large `x0`.\\n\\n2.  **Least Upper Bound Formula**: For a function `f(x0)`, the tightest possible upper bound formula is `f(x0)` itself, as it perfectly describes the growth rate. Therefore, the least upper bound formula is `0.00136728334317326 * exp(x0^(0.19356444))`. This formula is an exponential function, satisfying the requirement.\\n\\n3.  **Explanation of Upper Bound**: This formula is an upper bound because `f(x0) <= f(x0)` is always true. It is the *least* upper bound because no function that grows asymptotically slower than `f(x0)` can bound it from above for sufficiently large `x0`. It represents the exact asymptotic growth of the given expression.\\n\\n4.  **Complexity**: The complexity of an exponential function `exp(g(x0))` is `O(exp(g(x0)))`. In this case, `g(x0) = x0^alpha`. Thus, the complexity of the upper bound formula is `O(exp(x0^(0.19356444)))`. This is a sub-exponential complexity (since `alpha < 1`) but still super-polynomial.",
