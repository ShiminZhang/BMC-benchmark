  "reasoning": "The given expression is `1.695565e - 8 * x0 * * 2`. Based on the clarification `** means power 2**2 is 2^2`, we interpret `* * 2` as `**2`. Thus, the expression is `(1.695565 * 10^-8) * x0^2`. Let `C = 1.695565 * 10^-8`. The expression is `C * x0^2`.\n\nThe question asks for the least upper bound formula 'when K is large'. Since `K` is not explicitly in the expression, but is specified as the variable for which the upper bound is sought, we assume that `x0` represents `K` for the purpose of asymptotic analysis. Therefore, we consider the function `f(K) = C * K^2`.\n\nThis is a polynomial function of degree 2. For any polynomial `a_n K^n + ... + a_0`, its asymptotic least upper bound is determined by its highest degree term, `a_n K^n`. In this case, the highest degree term is `C * K^2`. The least upper bound formula, as requested to be an exponential or polynomial function, is `K^2` (ignoring the constant factor `C` as it does not change the asymptotic growth rate).\n\nThis is an upper bound because for any sufficiently large `K`, `C * K^2 <= D * K^2` for any `D >= C`. It is the *least* upper bound because `K^2` is the tightest possible polynomial bound; any function growing slower than `K^2` (e.g., `K` or `K log K`) would eventually be surpassed by `C * K^2`.",
