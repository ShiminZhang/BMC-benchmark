    "reasoning": "The given expression is `1.17877406e - 7 * x0 * * 1.0678749`. We interpret `* *` as the exponentiation operator, as indicated by the user's example `2**2 is 2^2`. The phrase 'when K is large' and the requirement for the formula to be 'an exponential function or a polynomial function with integer exponent' strongly suggest that `K` is the integer exponent of `x0`.\n\nTherefore, we interpret the expression as `(1.17877406e - 7) * x0^K * (1.0678749)`. The number `1.0678749` is treated as a constant multiplier, not the exponent, because if it were the exponent, it would not be an integer, violating the user's condition for a polynomial function. Since `K` is 'large', it implies `K` is an integer greater than 1, fitting the definition of a polynomial function.\n\nLet's combine the constant terms:\n`Constant = 1.17877406e - 7 * 1.0678749 = 0.00000012589899000000001`.\nWe can write this as `1.2589899e-7`.\n\nSo, the function is `f(x0) = 1.2589899e-7 * x0^K`.\n\n1.  **Least Upper Bound Formula:** For a positive function `f(x0)` (assuming `x0 > 0`), the least upper bound is the function itself. Thus, the formula is `1.2589899e-7 * x0^K`.\n2.  **Type of Equation:** Since `K` is a large integer (and thus `K > 1`), this is a polynomial function with an integer exponent, as per the user's definition.\n3.  **Complexity:** In complexity theory, the asymptotic upper bound (Big-O notation) for a polynomial function `C * x0^K` is `O(x0^K)`.",
