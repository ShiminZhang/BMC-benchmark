    "reasoning": "The given expression is `3.333927e - 7 * x0`. Let `C = 3.333927 * 10^-7`. The expression can be written as `f(x0) = C * x0`.\n\n1.  **Type of Equation**: This is a linear function. Although linear functions are a subset of polynomial functions (specifically, polynomials of degree 1), the user's note \"X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!\" indicates a preference for classifying it as 'linear' when the exponent is 1. Therefore, the `type_of_equation` is 'linear'.\n\n2.  **Upper Bound Formula**: The problem asks for the 'least upper bound formula'. For a function `f(x0) = C * x0` where `C` is a positive constant, the function itself serves as its own least upper bound. This formula `C * x0` is a polynomial function with an integer exponent (1), satisfying the requirement for the form of the upper bound. Thus, the least upper bound formula is `3.333927e - 7 * x0`.\n\n3.  **Complexity**: The complexity of a linear function `C * x0` is `O(x0)`. This indicates that the growth rate of the function is directly proportional to `x0`.",
