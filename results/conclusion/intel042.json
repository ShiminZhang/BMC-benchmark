    "reasoning": "The given function `f(x0) = 1.28055834929505 * exp(1.9893848e - 7 * x0)` is an exponential function. For large values of `x0`, exponential functions grow faster than any polynomial function. Therefore, a polynomial function cannot serve as an upper bound for this exponential function over an infinite domain or for sufficiently large `x0`. The only suitable type of upper bound, as per the problem's constraints (exponential or polynomial), is an exponential function. The least (tightest) upper bound formula for a function `f(x0)` that is itself an exponential function is `f(x0)` itself. Any other exponential function `g(x0)` that is strictly greater than `f(x0)` would not be the *least* upper bound. Thus, the function itself serves as its own least upper bound formula.",
