  "reasoning": "The given expression is `f(x) = 1.4842482e-6 * x`. This is a linear function. The term 'K is large' is irrelevant as `K` does not appear in the expression. The least upper bound for any function `f(x)` is `f(x)` itself, as `f(x) <= f(x)` is always true, and it is the tightest possible bound. The function `1.4842482e-6 * x` is a polynomial of degree 1, which the prompt explicitly classifies as 'linear'. The complexity of a linear function is `O(x)`.",
