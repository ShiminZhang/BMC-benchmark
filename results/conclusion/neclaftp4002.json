  "reasoning": "The given expression is `f(x0) = 2.4235845e - 7 * x0`. Let `C = 2.4235845e - 7`. So, the expression is `C * x0`. This is a linear function of `x0`.\\n\\nIn complexity theory, the tightest asymptotic upper bound for a linear function `C * x0` is `O(x0)`. However, the problem statement explicitly restricts the form of the upper bound formula:\\n1.  It must be either an exponential function or a polynomial function with an integer exponent.\\n2.  It states: \\",
