  "reasoning": "The given expression is `f(x0) = 3.8028449409941e - 7 * x0`. This is a linear function, where `x0` is the variable and `3.8028449409941e - 7` is a positive constant (let's call it `C`).\n\nIn complexity theory, the least upper bound for a function `f(x0) = C * x0` is typically expressed using Big-O notation as `O(x0)`. The question asks for the 'least upper bound formula'. The function `g(x0) = x0` serves as the representative formula for this complexity class.\n\nTo demonstrate that `g(x0) = x0` is an upper bound for `f(x0)`:\nWe need to find a constant `c > 0` and a threshold `x_naught` such that `f(x0) <= c * g(x0)` for all `x0 >= x_naught`.\nSubstituting the functions: `3.8028449409941e - 7 * x0 <= c * x0`.\nWe can choose `c = 1`. Since `C = 3.8028449409941e - 7` is a positive constant and `C < 1`, the inequality `C * x0 <= 1 * x0` holds true for all `x0 >= 0`. Therefore, `x0` is a valid upper bound.\n\nThis upper bound `x0` is also the *least* (tightest) upper bound in the context of asymptotic analysis, as it accurately reflects the growth rate of the original function.\n\nThe formula `x0` can be written as `x0^1`, which is a polynomial function with an integer exponent (1), satisfying the specified format requirement.\n\nThe phrase 'when K is large' does not alter the fundamental linear nature of the given expression, as `K` is not a variable or exponent within `3.8028449409941e - 7 * x0`.",
