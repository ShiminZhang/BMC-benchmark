  "reasoning": "The given expression is `f(x) = 4.79999999997149e - 7 * x`, where `x` represents the input variable `x0`. Let `C = 4.79999999997149e - 7`. So, the function is `f(x) = C * x`.\n\n1.  **Type of Equation**: This is a linear function. A linear function is a polynomial function of degree 1, as it can be written in the form `a_1x^1 + a_0x^0`. This fits the requirement for a 'polynomial function with integer exponent'.\n\n2.  **Least Upper Bound Formula**: In mathematics, the least upper bound (or supremum) of a function `f(x)` is `f(x)` itself, assuming `f(x)` is defined over its domain. No other function can be strictly less than `f(x)` at any point and still serve as an upper bound for `f(x)` over its entire domain. Therefore, the least upper bound formula for `C * x` is `C * x` itself.\n\n3.  **Explanation of Upper Bound**: For any `x >= 0`, it is trivially true that `C * x <= C * x`. This demonstrates that `C * x` is an upper bound for itself. It is the *least* upper bound because any function `g(x)` that is strictly less than `C * x` for even a single value of `x` cannot be an upper bound for `C * x` over its entire domain.\n\n4.  **'When K is large'**: This phrase, common in complexity theory, indicates that we are interested in the asymptotic behavior of the function as the input size (`x`) grows large. The form of the function `C * x` remains linear regardless of the magnitude of `x`.\n\n5.  **Complexity of the Upper Bound Formula**: The complexity of the function `C * x` is determined by its highest-order term. In Big-O notation, constant factors are ignored. Thus, the complexity of `C * x` is `O(x)`, indicating linear growth.",
