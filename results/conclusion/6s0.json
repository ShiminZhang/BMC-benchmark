  "reasoning": "The given expression is `0.026651703 * 0.904507 * x0 * x0 * (x0 - 0.73681104) * 1.2212989`. \\n\\n1.  **Simplify the expression**: We combine the constant numerical factors and interpret `x0 * x0` as `x0^2`.\\n    Let `C_coeff = 0.026651703 * 0.904507 * 1.2212989`.\\n    `C_coeff = 0.029448000000000003` (calculated value).\\n    Let `C_offset = 0.73681104`.\\n    The expression becomes `f(x0) = C_coeff * x0^2 * (x0 - C_offset)`.\\n\\n2.  **Expand the polynomial**: `f(x0) = C_coeff * x0^3 - C_coeff * C_offset * x0^2`.\\n\\n3.  **Identify the type of equation**: This is a polynomial function of `x0` with the highest degree term `x0^3`. The leading coefficient `C_coeff` is positive.\\n\\n4.  **Determine the least upper bound formula**: For a polynomial `P(x) = a_n x^n + ... + a_0` where `a_n > 0`, the function grows to positive infinity as `x` approaches positive infinity.
