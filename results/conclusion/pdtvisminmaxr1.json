  "reasoning": "The given expression is `6.272426e - 7 * x0`, which can be written as `C * x0` where `C = 6.272426 * 10^-7` is a positive constant. This is a linear function of `x0`.\n\nIn complexity theory, the 'least upper bound formula' refers to the tightest asymptotic upper bound. For a linear function `f(x0) = C * x0`, its asymptotic growth rate is linear. This is represented by `O(x0)`.\n\nTo show `C * x0 = O(x0)`, we need to find positive constants `c` and `x_0` such that `C * x0 <= c * x0` for all `x0 >= x_0`. We can choose `c = 1` (since `C < 1` in this specific case, `C * x0 <= 1 * x0` for `x0 >= 0`) or more generally, `c = C` (if `C >= 1`) or any `c >= C`. For `x0 >= 0`, `C * x0 <= x0` holds true because `C` is a positive constant less than 1. Thus, `x0` serves as a valid upper bound.\n\nThe formula `x0` is a polynomial function with an integer exponent (specifically, `x0^1`), which satisfies the requirement for the formula type. It is the 'least' upper bound in the sense that it represents the exact asymptotic growth rate (i.e., `Theta(x0)`).\n\nThe 'K is large' context does not affect the form of this specific linear expression.",
