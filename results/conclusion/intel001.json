    "reasoning": "The given expression is `F(x0) = 3.73293e - 14 * x0^(2.4586387)`. The `* *` operator is interpreted as exponentiation, as specified in the prompt. Let `C = 3.73293e - 14` and `alpha = 2.4586387`. So, `F(x0) = C * x0^alpha`.\n\n1.  **Type of Equation**: The function `F(x0)` is a power function with a positive, non-integer exponent (`alpha = 2.4586387`). In complexity theory, functions of the form `x^k` where `k > 0` are generally classified as having polynomial growth. Therefore, the `type_of_equation` is 'polynomial'.\n\n2.  **Least Upper Bound Formula**: The prompt requires the upper bound formula to be either an exponential function or a polynomial function with an integer exponent. We need to find the 'least' (tightest) such upper bound.\n    *   **Polynomial Upper Bound**: For large `x0`, we need to find the smallest integer `k` such that `x0^k` is an upper bound for `x0^alpha`. Since `alpha = 2.4586387`, we have `2 < alpha < 3`. Thus, for `x0 > 1`, `x0^alpha < x0^3`. The smallest integer exponent `k` that satisfies this condition is `k = 3`. Therefore, `C * x0^3` is a polynomial upper bound with an integer exponent.\n    *   **Exponential Upper Bound**: Any exponential function `A * B^x0` (with `B > 1`) grows asymptotically much faster than any polynomial function `x0^k`. Therefore, `C * x0^3` is a significantly tighter upper bound than any exponential function.\n    *   **Conclusion**: The least upper bound formula that fits the specified criteria is `3.73293e - 14 * x0^3`.\n\n3.  **Complexity of the Upper Bound**: The upper bound formula `3.73293e - 14 * x0^3` is a polynomial of degree 3. Its asymptotic complexity is `O(x0^3)`.",
