  "reasoning": "The given expression is `f(x0) = C * x0`, where `C = - 8.8773011300279e - 9` is a negative constant. In complexity theory, variables like `x0` (representing input size) are typically assumed to be non-negative (`x0 \\u2265 0`).\\n\\n1.  **Function Behavior**: For `x0 \\u2265 0`, since `C` is negative, `f(x0)` is a strictly decreasing function. This means its maximum value occurs at the smallest possible `x0` in its domain.\\n2.  **Least Upper Bound**: For the domain `x0 \\u2265 0`, the smallest value `x0` can take is `0`. At `x0 = 0`, `f(0) = C * 0 = 0`. For any `x0 > 0`, `f(x0)` will be a negative value. Therefore, `f(x0) \\u2264 0` for all `x0 \\u2265 0`. The least upper bound (supremum) of `f(x0)` over this domain is `0`.\\n3.  **Formula Type**: The constant function `g(x0) = 0` is a polynomial function of degree 0 (e.g., `0 \\u00b7 x^0`). It is also a linear function (`y = 0x + 0`). This satisfies the requirement for the formula type.\\n4.  **",
