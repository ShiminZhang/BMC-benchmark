  "reasoning": "The given expression simplifies to a polynomial function: `E(x0) = -0.066378 x0^4 + 0.007274 x0^3 + 0.150198 x0^2`. The leading coefficient of this polynomial is negative (`-0.066378`). Therefore, as `x0` approaches positive or negative infinity, the function `E(x0)` approaches negative infinity. In such cases, the least upper bound of the function is its global maximum value.\\n\\nTo find the global maximum, we compute the derivative of `E(x0)` and find its roots (critical points). The derivative is `E",
