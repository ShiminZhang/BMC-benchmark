  "reasoning": "The given expression is `f(x0) = C * x0`, where `C = 1.49999999905504e - 5` is a positive constant. This is a linear function. In complexity theory, the 'least upper bound formula' refers to the tightest asymptotic upper bound, typically represented by the simplest function `g(x0)` such that `f(x0) = O(g(x0))`. For a linear function `C * x0`, the tightest asymptotic upper bound is `x0`.\n\n1.  **Why it is an upper bound:** For `x0 >= 0`, since `C = 1.49999999905504e - 5` is less than 1, we have `C * x0 <= x0`. Thus, `x0` serves as a literal upper bound for `f(x0)` for non-negative `x0` values. Asymptotically, `f(x0) = O(x0)` because we can choose `M=1` (or any `M >= C`) and `x_0=0` such that `|C * x0| <= M * |x0|` for all `x0 >= x_0`.\n2.  **Why it is the least upper bound:** No function that grows asymptotically slower than `x0` (e.g., `log(x0)`, `sqrt(x0)`, or a constant) can serve as an upper bound for `C * x0`, as `C * x0` will eventually surpass them. Therefore, `x0` represents the tightest possible asymptotic upper bound.\n3.  **Formula type:** `x0` is a polynomial function with an integer exponent (1), satisfying the requirement for the formula type.",
