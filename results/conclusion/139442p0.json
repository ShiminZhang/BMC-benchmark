    "reasoning": "1.  **Analyze the given equation:** The equation is `f(x) = 3.1397738e - 7 * x`. Let `C = 3.1397738e - 7`. So, `f(x) = C * x`. This is a linear function of `x` (assuming `x` is the variable, typically representing input size in complexity theory). `C` is a positive constant. \n2.  **Address the 'K is large' condition:** The parameter `K` is mentioned as being large, but it does not appear in the given expression `3.1397738e - 7 * x`. Therefore, `K` is irrelevant to determining the upper bound of this specific formula.\n3.  **Determine the type of equation:** A linear function `C * x` is a polynomial function of degree 1. This satisfies the requirement for the upper bound to be an exponential or polynomial function with an integer exponent.\n4.  **Find the least upper bound formula:** For any function `f(x)`, the least upper bound (or tightest possible upper bound) is `f(x)` itself, as `f(x) <= f(x)` is always true. Therefore, the least upper bound formula for `3.1397738e - 7 * x` is `3.1397738e - 7 * x`.\n5.  **Explain why it is the upper bound:** For any non-negative value of `x` (typical in complexity analysis), the value of the function `3.1397738e - 7 * x` is always less than or equal to itself. It is the tightest possible upper bound because no function `g(x)` such that `g(x) < 3.1397738e - 7 * x` for all `x` can serve as an upper bound.\n6.  **Analyze the complexity:** The function `3.1397738e - 7 * x` grows linearly with `x`. In Big O notation, its complexity is `O(x)`.",
