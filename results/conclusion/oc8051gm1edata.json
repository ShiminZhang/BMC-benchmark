  "reasoning": "The given equation is `f(x0) = C * x0`, where `C = 6.54104160240365e-5`. This is a linear function of `x0`. In the context of complexity theory, the 'least upper bound formula' refers to the tightest asymptotic upper bound. For any positive constant `C`, the function `C * x0` is asymptotically bounded by `x0`. This is because we can find positive constants `M` and `x0_0` such that `|C * x0| <= M * |x0|` for all `x0 >= x0_0`. Specifically, we can choose `M = C` and `x0_0 = 0`, so `C * x0 <= C * x0` for `x0 >= 0`. This demonstrates that `C * x0 = O(x0)`. Furthermore, `C * x0 = Omega(x0)` (by choosing `m = C` and `x0_0 = 0`), which means `C * x0 = Theta(x0)`. Therefore, `x0` represents the least (tightest) asymptotic upper bound formula. According to the instruction 'X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!', the `type_of_equation` for `x0^1` is 'linear'. The complexity of the upper bound formula `x0` is `O(x0)`.",
