    "reasoning": "The given expression is `3.806326e - 15 * x0 * * 2.7269208`. Following the prompt's clarification that `**` means power, we interpret `x0 * * 2.7269208` as `x0 ** 2.7269208`. The constant coefficient `3.806326e - 15` does not affect the asymptotic growth rate.\n\nThe variable in question is `x0`, and we are asked for the upper bound when `K` is large. In complexity theory, this implies we are looking for the asymptotic behavior as `x0` tends to infinity.\n\nThe core of the function's growth is determined by `x0 ** 2.7269208`. The exponent `2.7269208` is a positive real number but not an integer.\n\nThe prompt specifies that the upper bound formula must be either an exponential function or a polynomial function with an integer exponent. For a non-integer exponent `E`, the least polynomial upper bound with an integer exponent `n` (for large `x0`) is `x0^n` where `n` is the smallest integer greater than or equal to `E` (i.e., `n = ceil(E)`).\n\nIn this case, `E = 2.7269208`. The smallest integer greater than or equal to `2.7269208` is `3`. Therefore, `x0 ** 2.7269208` is asymptotically bounded by `x0 ** 3`.\n\nThe formula `x0 ** 3` is a polynomial function with an integer exponent (3). The prompt also states that `X^K` with `K<=1` is considered linear, not polynomial. Since our exponent `3` is greater than `1`, `x0 ** 3` fits the criteria for a polynomial function.\n\nThus, the least upper bound formula is `x0 ** 3`.\n\nThe type of equation is polynomial, and its complexity is `O(x0^3)`.",
