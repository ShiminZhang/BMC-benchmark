  "reasoning": "The given expression is `f(x0) = 3.2145638e - 7 * x0`. This is a linear function of `x0`.\n\nThe problem requires the upper bound formula to be either an exponential function or a polynomial function with an integer exponent. A critical constraint is provided: 'X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!'. This non-standard definition means that `x0^1` (which is `x0`) is considered linear and not a polynomial in this context.\n\nTherefore, we cannot provide `x0` (or `C * x0`) as the upper bound, even though it would be the tightest asymptotic bound (`Theta(x0)`), because it does not fit the user's definition of a 'polynomial function with integer exponent' (it's considered linear).\n\nWe must choose a polynomial with an integer exponent `K > 1` or an exponential function. To find the 'least upper bound formula' among these allowed types, we select the one that grows slowest while still bounding `f(x0)` from above for large `x0`.\n\n1.  **Polynomials with integer exponent `K > 1`**: The smallest integer exponent greater than 1 is `K=2`. Thus, `x0**2` is the simplest and 'least' (slowest growing) polynomial of this type.\n2.  **Exponential functions**: An example is `e**x0`.\n\nComparing `x0**2` and `e**x0`, `x0**2` grows significantly slower than `e**x0` for large `x0`. Therefore, `x0**2` is the 'least upper bound formula' that satisfies all the specified conditions.\n\nFor `x0 >= 3.2145638e - 7`, `3.2145638e - 7 * x0 <= x0**2`, confirming it is a valid upper bound for relevant `x0` values.",
