  "reasoning": "The given expression is `3.7390616e - 6 * x0`. Let `C = 3.7390616 * 10^-6`. The expression can be written as `C * x0`. This is a linear function of `x0`.\n\nThe condition 'when K is large' is irrelevant because the variable `K` is not present in the expression `C * x0`. Its value does not affect the function.\n\nFor a function `f(x0) = C * x0` (where `C` is a positive constant and assuming `x0 >= 0` as is typical in complexity theory), the least upper bound is the function itself. This is because `f(x0)` is the exact value, and no function `g(x0)` can be an upper bound if `g(x0) < f(x0)` for any `x0` in the domain. Therefore, `C * x0` is the tightest possible upper bound.\n\nThe formula `C * x0` is a polynomial function of degree 1 (since `x0 = x0^1`), and `1` is an integer exponent. It also fits the description of a linear function, which is a specific type of polynomial function. Thus, it satisfies the requirement for the type of formula.",
