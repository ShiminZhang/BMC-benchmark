  "reasoning": "The given expression is `f(x0) = (3.2341324 * 10^-10) * x0^(1.8928012)`. This is a power function. In complexity theory, we are interested in the asymptotic behavior of functions as the input variable (here, `x0`) becomes large. The constant coefficient `3.2341324 * 10^-10` does not affect the asymptotic growth rate.\\n\\nThe core growth factor is `x0^(1.8928012)`. The problem requires the upper bound formula to be either an exponential function or a polynomial function with an integer exponent. Since `x0^(1.8928012)` is not an exponential function (the variable `x0` is in the base, not the exponent), we must provide a polynomial function with an integer exponent.\\n\\nTo find the least upper bound that fits this criterion, we need to find the smallest integer `M` such that `x0^(1.8928012)` is `O(x0^M)`. Since `1.8928012` is a positive real number greater than 1, the smallest integer `M` that is greater than or equal to `1.8928012` is `2`. Therefore, `x0^2` serves as the least upper bound satisfying the integer exponent requirement.\\n\\nThis is an upper bound because for sufficiently large `x0`, `x0^(1.8928012)` grows slower than `x0^2`. Formally, `lim (x0 -> infinity) [ x0^(1.8928012) / x0^2 ] = lim (x0 -> infinity) [ 1 / x0^(2 - 1.8928012) ] = lim (x0 -> infinity) [ 1 / x0^0.1071988 ] = 0`. A limit of 0 implies that `x0^(1.8928012)` is `o(x0^2)`, which means it is also `O(x0^2)`.\\n\\nThe complexity of the upper bound formula `x0^2` is `O(x0^2)`.",
