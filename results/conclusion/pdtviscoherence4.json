  "reasoning": "The given expression is `6.77507e - 11 * x0 * * 2`. \n1.  **Parsing the expression**: `6.77507e - 11` is a constant, let's denote it as `C = 6.77507 * 10^-11`. The `* * 2` notation, as clarified by the user (`** means power 2**2 is 2^2`), indicates exponentiation. Therefore, `* * 2` means `^2`. The variable is `x0`, which we will represent as `x` in the formula. So, the expression is `f(x) = C * x^2`.\n2.  **Type of equation**: Since `C` is a constant and the highest power of `x` is 2, this is a polynomial function of degree 2.\n3.  **Least Upper Bound**: In complexity theory, the least upper bound for a polynomial function `P(x) = a_n x^n + ... + a_0` (where `a_n != 0`) is `O(x^n)`. For `f(x) = C * x^2`, where `C` is a positive constant, the least upper bound is `O(x^2)`. When providing a formula for a Big-O bound, constant factors are typically omitted. Thus, the formula for the least upper bound is `x^2`.\n4.  **Explanation of Upper Bound**: For any `x >= 0`, `C * x^2 <= 1 * x^2` because `C = 6.77507 * 10^-11` is a positive constant less than 1. Therefore, `x^2` serves as an upper bound for `C * x^2`. It is the *least* upper bound because no function with a strictly lower growth rate (e.g., `x`, `log x`, or a constant) can bound `C * x^2` for all sufficiently large `x`.\n5.  **Irrelevance of K**: The phrase 'when K is large' provides a context for asymptotic analysis but `K` is not present in the expression `C * x^2`, so it does not directly influence the form or degree of the function.\n6.  **Complexity of the Upper Bound Formula**: The complexity of the formula `x^2` itself is `O(x^2)`.",
