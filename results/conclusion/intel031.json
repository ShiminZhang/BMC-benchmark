  "reasoning": "The given expression is `f(x) = (3.5920725 * 10^-10) * x^(1.4890373)`. Let `C = 3.5920725 * 10^-10`. The function is `f(x) = C * x^(1.4890373)`.\n\n1.  **Interpretation of 'K is large'**: In the context of complexity theory, 'K is large' refers to the asymptotic behavior of the input variable `x` (or `x0`) as it approaches infinity.\n\n2.  **Upper Bound Requirement**: The upper bound formula must be either an exponential function or a polynomial function with an integer exponent. For a power function `x^alpha`, an exponential function `a^x` (for `a > 1`) would be an upper bound, but it would not be the *least* upper bound as it grows significantly faster than `x^alpha`.\n\n3.  **Polynomial Upper Bound**: We seek a polynomial `g(x) = A * x^n` where `n` is an integer, such that `f(x) <= g(x)` for sufficiently large `x`. For this to hold, the exponent `n` must be greater than or equal to the exponent of `f(x)`, i.e., `n >= 1.4890373`. The smallest integer `n` that satisfies this condition is `n = 2`.\n\n4.  **Least Upper Bound**: The formula `x^2` serves as the least upper bound in terms of integer exponent degree. We verify this:\n    *   `x^1` (linear) is not an upper bound because `x^(1.4890373)` grows faster than `x^1` for large `x`.\n    *   `x^2` is an upper bound: We need to show `C * x^(1.4890373) <= x^2` for sufficiently large `x`. This is equivalent to `C <= x^(2 - 1.4890373)`, or `C <= x^(0.5109275)`. Since `C` is a small positive constant (`3.5920725 * 10^-10`) and `x^(0.5109275)` grows without bound as `x` increases, this inequality holds for all `x` greater than some threshold `x_0`. Therefore, `x^2` is a valid upper bound.\n\n5.  **Compliance with Formula Type**: The formula `x^2` is a polynomial function with an integer exponent (`2`), satisfying the prompt's requirement. The prompt's rule `X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!` implies that `X^K` with `K>1` (like `x^2`) is indeed considered polynomial.\n\n6.  **Complexity**: The complexity of the upper bound formula `x^2` is `O(x^2)`, which is a polynomial time complexity.",
