  "reasoning": "The given expression is `f(x0) = 4.27000000025046e - 7 * x0`. Let `C = 4.27000000025046 * 10^-7`. So, `f(x0) = C * x0`. This is a linear function of `x0`. In complexity theory, the least upper bound (or tight upper bound) for a function `f(x)` is `f(x)` itself, or more precisely, `O(f(x))`. Since `C` is a positive constant, `f(x0)` grows linearly with `x0`. A linear function `C * x0` is a polynomial function of degree 1, which satisfies the requirement for the formula type ('polynomial function with integer exponent'). The phrase 'when K is large' is not directly applicable to the given expression as `K` is not present. We assume `x0` is the variable whose growth determines the bound. The least upper bound formula is `C * x0` because for any `x0 > 0`, `C * x0 <= C * x0`. No tighter polynomial or exponential function can bound it from above without being asymptotically equivalent to `C * x0`.",
