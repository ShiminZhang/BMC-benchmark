    "reasoning": "The given expression is `1.91323022130672e - 8 * x0 * * 1.1521593`. Interpreting `* *` as the power operator, the expression is `C * x0 ^ A`, where `C = 1.91323022130672e - 8` and `A = 1.1521593`. Let's denote the variable `x0` as `x` for simplicity in the upper bound and complexity notation.\n\nThe problem asks for the least upper bound formula, with the strict constraint that \"the formula should either be an exponential function or a polynomial function with integer exponent.\" \n\n1.  **Analysis of the original function**: The function `f(x) = C * x ^ 1.1521593` is a power function. It is not an exponential function (as the variable `x` is in the base, not the exponent). It is also not a polynomial function with an *integer* exponent, because `1.1521593` is not an integer.\n\n2.  **Finding an upper bound of the specified type**: Since the original function does not fit the required form, we must find an upper bound `g(x)` that does. For large values of `x` (which is implied by \"when K is large\" in a complexity context, meaning `x >= 1`):\n    *   We need to find the smallest integer `k` such that `x ^ 1.1521593 <= x ^ k` for `x >= 1`. The smallest integer `k` greater than or equal to `1.1521593` is `k = 2`.\n    *   Therefore, `C * x ^ 1.1521593 <= C * x ^ 2` for `x >= 1`.\n    *   The function `g(x) = C * x ^ 2` is a polynomial function with an integer exponent (2), satisfying the problem's constraint.\n\n3.  **Least Upper Bound**: `C * x ^ 2` is the least upper bound that fits the specified form. Any polynomial with an integer exponent less than 2 (i.e., `C' * x ^ 1`) would eventually be smaller than `C * x ^ 1.1521593` for large `x`, and thus would not be an upper bound.\n\n4.  **Constant Value**: `C = 1.91323022130672e - 8` is `0.0000000191323022130672`.\n\nTherefore, the least upper bound formula that satisfies the given constraints is `0.0000000191323022130672 * x0^2`.",
