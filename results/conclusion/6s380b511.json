    "reasoning": "The given expression `- 3.7164955e - 5 * x0 * * 0.6972372` contains a syntax error with `* *`. Assuming this is a typo for a single multiplication operator `*`, the expression simplifies to `f(x0) = C * x0`, where `C = (-3.7164955e-5) * (0.6972372) = -0.000025909999999999997`. Thus, `C` is a negative constant.\n\nIn complexity theory, the variable `x0` (representing input size) is typically assumed to be non-negative (`x0 >= 0`). For a linear function `f(x0) = C * x0` with a negative coefficient `C`, the function is decreasing. Over the domain `x0 >= 0`, the maximum value occurs at `x0 = 0`, where `f(0) = C * 0 = 0`. Therefore, the least upper bound for this function is `0`.\n\nThe original equation `f(x0) = C * x0` is a linear function. The upper bound formula `0` is a constant function, which is a polynomial of degree 0. The complexity of this constant upper bound formula is `O(1)`.",
