This is a positive constant.\\n    *   The notation `* * 2` is clarified by the prompt as `**2`, meaning exponentiation. So, `x0 * * 2` is `x0^2`.\\n    *   Therefore, the expression can be written as `C * x0^2`. For the purpose of the upper bound formula and complexity, we will use `x` as the variable, so `C * x^2`.\\n\\n2.  **Role of \\",
