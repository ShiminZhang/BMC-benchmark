  "reasoning": "The given expression is `4.13999999997194e - 7 * x0`. Let `C = 4.13999999997194e - 7`. The expression can be written as `C * x0`.\n\n1.  **Type of Equation:** This is a linear function of `x0`. A linear function is a specific type of polynomial function where the highest power of the variable is 1 (an integer exponent).\n\n2.  **Irrelevance of K:** The phrase \"when K is large\" is noted, but the variable `K` does not appear in the provided expression. Therefore, `K` is not relevant to the formula or its upper bound, and we analyze the expression as given.\n\n3.  **Least Upper Bound Formula:** For a function `f(x0) = C * x0`, the least upper bound formula is `f(x0)` itself. This is because for any given `x0`, the value of the expression `C * x0` is precisely `C * x0`. No other formula can be a tighter upper bound while still being an upper bound for all relevant `x0` (assuming `C > 0` and `x0 >= 0`, which is typical for input sizes in complexity theory).\n\n4.  **Complexity Analysis:** The complexity of the upper bound formula `C * x0` is `O(x0)`. This is a linear complexity. According to the Big O definition, `f(x0) = C * x0` is `O(x0)` because we can find positive constants `M` and `x0_0` (e.g., `M = C` and `x0_0 = 1`) such that `|C * x0| <= M * |x0|` for all `x0 >= x0_0`.",
