  "reasoning": "The given expression is `2.87393096060713e - 7 * x0`. Let `C = 2.87393096060713 * 10^-7`. The expression is `C * x0`. This is a linear function of `x0`.\n\n1.  **Least Upper Bound:** For any function `f(x)`, the tightest (least) upper bound `g(x)` such that `f(x) <= g(x)` is `f(x)` itself. Therefore, the least upper bound formula for `C * x0` is `C * x0`.\n2.  **Formula Type:** A linear function `C * x0` is a polynomial function of degree 1, where the exponent of `x0` is 1 (an integer). This satisfies the requirement for the formula to be a polynomial function with an integer exponent.\n3.  **Irrelevance of K:** The variable `K` does not appear in the expression `C * x0`, so the condition 'when K is large' does not affect the form of the upper bound in terms of `x0`.\n4.  **Complexity:** The complexity of a linear function `C * x0` is `O(x0)`.",
