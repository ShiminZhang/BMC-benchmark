  "reasoning": "The given expression is `2.99999999953116e - 6 * x0`. Let `C = 2.99999999953116e - 6`. The expression can be written as `f(x0) = C * x0`. This is a linear function of `x0` with a positive constant coefficient `C`.\n\n**Least Upper Bound Formula:**\nIn complexity theory, the least upper bound for a function `f(x0)` is its tightest asymptotic upper bound, typically expressed using Big-O notation. For a linear function `f(x0) = C * x0` where `C > 0`, the least upper bound is `O(x0)`. The formula representing this bound is `x0`.\n\n**Why it is the upper bound:**\nBy the definition of Big-O notation, `f(x0) = O(g(x0))` if there exist positive constants `M` and `x_0` such that `|f(x0)| <= M * |g(x0)|` for all `x0 >= x_0`. For `f(x0) = C * x0` and `g(x0) = x0`:\n1.  Since `C = 2.99999999953116e - 6` is a positive constant, and `x0` (representing input size) is typically non-negative, we can write `C * x0` instead of `|C * x0|` and `x0` instead of `|x0|`.\n2.  We need to find `M` and `x_0` such that `C * x0 <= M * x0` for all `x0 >= x_0`.\n3.  We can choose `M = C` (or any `M >= C`) and `x_0 = 0`. Then, `C * x0 <= C * x0` holds true for all `x0 >= 0`.\nThis demonstrates that `x0` is a valid upper bound. It is the *least* upper bound because any function growing asymptotically slower than `x0` (e.g., a constant) would not bound `C * x0` for large `x0`, and any function growing asymptotically faster (e.g., `x0^2`) would not be the tightest possible bound.\n\n**Type of Equation:**\nThe original equation `2.99999999953116e - 6 * x0` is a linear function. Following the user's specific instruction: \"X^K with K<=1 is still linear, not polynomial!\", the `type_of_equation` is classified as \"linear\".\n\n**Complexity of the Upper Bound Formula:**\nThe upper bound formula is `x0`. The complexity of this formula is `O(x0)`, which represents linear complexity.",
