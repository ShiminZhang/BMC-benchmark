    "reasoning": "1.  **Analyze the given expression:** The expression is `3.4724877e - 7 * x0`. This can be rewritten as `(3.4724877 * 10^-7) * x0`. Let `C = 3.4724877 * 10^-7`. The expression is therefore `C * x0`.\n    2.  **Identify the variable:** We assume `x0` is the variable for which the upper bound is sought, typically representing an input size or quantity.\n    3.  **Address",
