    "reasoning": "The given expression is `8.518082e - 10 * x0 * * 2`. This can be accurately interpreted as `(8.518082 * 10^-10) * x0^2`. Let `C = 8.518082 * 10^-10`.\n\n1.  **Type of Equation**: The expression `C * x0^2` is a polynomial function of `x0` with a degree of 2. The exponent `2` is an integer, and it is greater than 1, which aligns with the user's specific definition of a 'polynomial' (distinguishing it from linear functions).\n\n2.  **Least Upper Bound Formula**: For a function `f(x0) = C * x0^2` where `C` is a positive constant, the function itself provides the least (tightest) upper bound. As `x0` grows, the value of the function `C * x0^2` grows quadratically. Any function `g(x0)` that serves as an upper bound must grow at least as fast as `x0^2`. Therefore, the formula for the least upper bound is `8.518082e - 10 * x0^2`.\n\n3.  **Irrelevance of 'K is large'**: The variable `K` is not present in the provided mathematical expression. Thus, the condition 'when K is large' does not affect the analysis or the upper bound of this specific formula. We analyze the bound with respect to the variable `x0`.\n\n4.  **Complexity of the Upper Bound Formula**: The complexity of a polynomial function of degree `n` is `O(x^n)`. For the upper bound formula `8.518082e - 10 * x0^2`, the dominant term is `x0^2`, so its complexity is `O(x0^2)`.",
