  "reasoning": "The given expression is `8.454611e - 7 * x0`. Let `C = 8.454611 * 10^-7`. The expression is `C * x0`.\n\n1.  **Irrelevance of K**: The variable `K` does not appear in the expression `C * x0`. Therefore, the condition 'when K is large' does not affect the form or value of this specific expression. We consider `x0` as the variable for which we are finding the upper bound.\n2.  **Type of Equation**: The expression `C * x0` is a linear function. A linear function is a specific type of polynomial function where the highest power of the variable is 1 (i.e., `x0^1`). The exponent (1) is an integer, which fits the requirement for a 'polynomial function with integer exponent'.\n3.  **Least Upper Bound Formula**: For any positive constant `C`, the function `f(x0) = C * x0` is its own least upper bound. This is because for any value of `x0`, the expression evaluates exactly to `C * x0`. Thus, `C * x0` is an upper bound. It is the *least* upper bound because no function `g(x0)` that is asymptotically smaller than `C * x0` (e.g., `(C - epsilon) * x0` for any `epsilon > 0`) can serve as an upper bound for all sufficiently large `x0`.\n4.  **Complexity Analysis**: The complexity of a linear function `C * x0` is `O(x0)`. This indicates that the growth rate of the function is directly proportional to `x0`.",
